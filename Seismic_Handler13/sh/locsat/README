Installation Manager,

	To install the location-related NMRD software, LocSAT, PredSAT and
TTTab, on your UNIX-based system first uncompress the given file loc_tar.Z.
Then extract the information from the now uncompressed tar file, loc_tar, 
in the working directory of your choice.  If LocSAT is being installed on 
a SUN sparc system the user only need run the executable in the immediate 
bin directory.  Test files are included in the directories, src/LocSAT/tst 
and src/PredSAT/tst.  If the installation manager wishes to build from 
scratch or desires to run the code on a non-sparc system the following, then 
just run the top-level Makefile, make_loc provided here.  That is, run as: 

% make -f make_loc install

in your current directory.  The executable will be installed in the bin 
directory and you're ready to go.

	Please note that there is a manual page for LocSAT in directory,
doc/man/man1.  There are no man pages for PredSAT and TTTab although the
main prologues in their source code directories are sufficiently documented 
that user's should have little trouble executing them.

	For any specific questions, I can be reached at the SAIC office in 
San Diego, as follows,
