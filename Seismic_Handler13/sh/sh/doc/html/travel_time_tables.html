<H2>The travel time tables of SH/SHM</H2>
<P>For several options SH/SHM use its own travel time tables. All the
file must reside in <em>$SH_INPUTS</em>
and have an extension <em>.TTT</em>.
For historic reasons (the VAX/VMS origin of the program) the travel
time table filenames use all uppercase letters. To translate a
phasename with lowercase letters in it to the corresponding filename
convert the lowercase letter to uppercase and precede it by an
uppercase <em>V</em>.
E.g. the phase <em>pPcP</em>
translates into the filename <em>VPPVCP.TTT</em>.
The format of the files is described below. The travel time tables
supplied in the distribution are based on the IASP91 velocity model
(for teleseismic phases). They were created using the program <em>ttimes</em>
of Ray Buland. You may replace the existing files by your own version
(but keep a copy of your files on a private directory, so you can
restore them after making a complete update of SH/SHM) or add travel
times tables of new phases to the directory. SHM makes no
restrictions on using arbitrary phasenames, except phases starting
with lowercase <em>b</em>
and phases with <em>V</em>
or <em>v</em> in
the name (see above).</P>
<P>The format of the files</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Lines at the beginning of the file
	starting with an exclamation sign <em>!</em>
	are regarded as comment and ignored. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The first data line contains the
	three characters <em>TTT</em>.
		</P>
	<LI><P>The next line is ignored. It
	usually contains the distance bounds.</P>
	<LI><P>The next line contains two
	floating point numbers, separated by blank(s), specifying the
	interval of epicentral distance (lower and upper bound in degrees)
	where this table has travel time values. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The next line is ignored. It
	usually contains the depth steps of the travel times lines.</P>
	<LI><P>The next line starts with an
	integer <em>N</em>,
	specifying the number of depths steps following in this line.
	Appended are <em>N</em>
	floating point numbers giving the depth grid points of the following
	table. They need not to be equidistant, but most of them are. All
	numbers must be separated by blanks. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The following lines hold the travel time information for the
	phase. The first (floating point) number in each line tells the
	distance value, followed by <em>N</em>
	travel times (floating point, in s), one for each depth specified in
	the depth line above. A value of <em>0</em>
	indicates that there could be no travel time computed for this
	distance/depth combination. The distance grid needs not to be
	equidistant, however it should span the distance interval specified
	in the beginning of the file. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>When a travel time is computed, SHM reads the table of the phase
and interpolates linearly in both variables, distance and depth.</P>
