<H2>Plugins</H2>
<P>SHM provides an interface for the integration of external
programs. These external programs may operate on the parameter data
gathered so far or on waveform data exported in ASCII data files.
Parameter data can also be reimported into SHM. Parameter data
exchange format is the text based evt-File format. Typical examples
of such programs are mapping tools for epicentres or own location
programs. But, of course, many more types of applications can be
implemented by the user.</P>
<P><A NAME="Anker2408454"></A>The interface is controlled by a text
file located in the user's private directory:
<em>$SH_USERDIR/external_processes.txt</em>.
Configurable are the twenty (ten up to version SHM-2.3a) plugin entries
of the <em>Plugin</em>
submenu under <em>Specials</em>,
one of the two location buttons of the <em>LocSAT</em>
dialog box and routines executed after activation of <em>Read
New</em> and <em>Final
Parameters</em>. The syntax of the file entries is:</P>
<P><em>&lt;command&gt;
&lt;iface-number&gt; &lt;parameter&gt;</em></P>
<P>Lines beginning with <em>!</em>
are comments and are ignored. The items specified on the lines must
be separated by one or more blanks. The items itself therefore must
not contain any blanks.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><em>&lt;iface-number&gt;</em></P>
<P>Integer number specifying the interface number. The numbers 1 to
20 (10 up to version 2.3a) refer to the twenty menu entries of the plugin
submenu (from top to bottom). Number 21 (11 up to version 2.3a) stands for
the second location button in the
LocSAT dialog box. This is preferably connected with a location
program (which is not checked, however). Number 22 (12 up to version 2.3a)
is a routine called after <em>Read New</em>
of the read dialog box has been selected, number 23 (13 up to version 2.3a)
is a routine called after <em>Final
Parameters</em> has been activated. By default, all plugin
entries are empty, i.e. no action is associated. Usually several
commands are associated with a plugin interface, which means that
several lines exist for each interface number in the
<em>external_processes.txt</em>
file. Even if not required by the software, it is recommended to
group the commands sorted by interface number.</P>
<P><em>&lt;command&gt;</em>
and <em>&lt;parameter&gt;</em></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Available commands are:</P>
<DL>
	<DD><BR>
	</DD><DD>
	<em>label</em></DD><DD>
	Set name of the entry, this name appears in the menu entry and in
	the button (number 21), for interface number 22 and 23 this has no
	meaning. <em>&lt;parameter&gt;</em>
	is a text string containing the name. Please replace all blanks in
	the name by underscores '_'.</DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	<em>writeevt</em></DD><DD>
	Write out evt-file with the current analysis parameters to the
	<em>$SH_SCRATCH</em>
	directory. <em>&lt;parameter&gt;</em>
	contains the name of the evt-file.</DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	<em>shell</em></DD><DD>
	Call external program and pass an eventually written file (<em>writeevt</em>)
	as parameter. <em>&lt;parameter&gt;</em>
	contains the name of the program called. Default path is the user's
	private directory <em>$SH_USERDIR</em>,
	otherwise absolute paths have to be used.</DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	<em>bgshell</em></DD><DD>
	Flag. Indicates whether a separately specified shell command of this
	interface number should be executed in background. Default behaviour
	(without this flag) is that SHM waits until the shell command has
	finished. <em>&lt;parameter&gt;</em>
	is not used.</DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	<em>resetpar</em></DD><DD>
	Deletes all analysis parameters and phase picks of SHM. Usually this
	command is called before a <em>readevt</em>
	command to have the parameter set cleared. Please make sure that the
	following <em>readevt</em>
	command is successful, otherwise the analysis done so far is lost.
	That means the external program should provide at least the input
	evt-file for reading (created by <em>writeevt</em>)
	if some problem during execution arises. <em>&lt;parameter&gt;</em>
	is not used.</DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	<em>remtheo</em></DD><DD>
	Delete theoretical phases in the display window. <em>&lt;parameter&gt;</em>
	is not used. This action is included in <em>resetpar</em>.</DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	<em>waveform</em></DD><DD>
	Write the content of the current display window (waveform data) in
	ASCII format to disk. <em>&lt;parameter&gt;</em>
	specifies the name of the output file. Default path is <em>$SH_SCRATCH</em>.</DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	<em>currwindow</em></DD><DD>
	Write out the currently set display time window into a text file.
	The name of the text file is given in <em>&lt;parameter&gt;</em>.</DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	<em>shcfile</em></DD><DD>
	Call SH-script. <em>&lt;parameter&gt;</em>
	contains the name of the script (.SHC-file). Only recommended for SH
	experts.</DD><DD><BR>
   <em>readevt</em></DD><DD>
   Read in evt-file.  Return event information into SHM.  This file is usually
   created by an external program, e.g. called in a <em>shell</em> command.
   Please note the remarks given in <em>resetpar</em>.
	</DD><DD><BR>
   <em>reread</em></DD><DD>
   Available since version SHM 2.3c (9-Mar-2006).
   Reread the plugin definitions from <em>external_processes.txt</em>.  In case
   that you want to change the plugin entries on the fly you can reread your
   changed definitions here.
	</DD>
</DL>
	

<p>
Please note that there is only one command of a type per plugin entry available.
If you specify e.g. two <em>shell</em> commands within one iface-number then the
second <em>shell</em> overwrites the first.  The order of execution is also
fixed to: <em>writeevt</em>, <em>waveform</em>, <em>shcfile</em>,
<em>remtheo</em>, <em>resetpar</em>, <em>readevt</em>, <em>reread</em>.
</p>

<P>An example entry in
<em>external_processes.txt</em>
would look like:</P>
<P><pre>
label    1 Preview_Map
writeevt 1 epimap.evt
shell    1 preview_map.csh
</pre></P>
<P>The first line sets the name in the first menu entry
to <em>Preview Map</em>,
the second creates an output file <em>$SH_SCRATCH/epimap.evt</em>
and the third line calls a plotting program to create a map around
the epicentre found in <em>epimap.evt</em>.
The program needs to read and interpret the evt-file format.</P>
<P>In case of a location program the lines would look
similar to</P>
<p><pre>
label    21 Hypocenter
writeevt 21 hypo.evt
shell    21 call_hypo.csh
resetpar 21
readevt  21 hypout.evt
</pre></P>
<p>If you have a version 2.3a or earlier replace number 21 by 11.</p>
<P>The additional entries <em>resetpar</em>
and <em>readevt</em>
replace the original parameter set and phase picks.  The <em>hypout.evt</em>
is an output of the <em>call_hypo.csh</em>
program.  This program must be able to read and write evt-files.  The
<em>hypout.evt</em>
file should include all information passed by <em>hypo.evt</em>
plus an added/modified epicenter location.</P>
