<H2>Menu entry <em>Theo (Tables)</em></H2>

<P>Computes theoretical phases on all traces on display using
travel time tables in $SH_INPUTS. First it opens a dialog box
showing a list of available phases. Some phases are preselected.
Phase which should be preselected when starting SHM may be set
by Configure (parameter number 2). Changing
the theo phase list in <em>Configure</em>
means to retype the complete phase list including or excluding
your changes. Please check for typos and do not use blanks, just
separate the phases by commas. In the dialog box the phase selections
may be changed arbitrarily. After clicking on
<em>OK</em> the phases are computed and marked
on the traces. If new travel time tables of new phases are supplied
in the directory <em>$SH_INPUTS</em>,
which are not available as buttons in the dialog box, add the
names of the phases to the editable text field in the lower right
corner. Again, do not use blanks, separate with commas if more
than one phase is specified.</P>

travel time tables of SH/SHM</A>.</P>
