<H2>Menu Entry <em>Beam</em></H2>

<P>This command takes the values of slowness and back-azimuth
from the <A HREF="parambox.html">analysis parameter box</A> and
computes delay times for each trace on display so that signals
of a plane wavefront of this orientation (given by slowness and
azimuth) are aligned in time. The delays are applied to the traces
and a sum trace is added to the display. The result of this operation
is good, that means the scatter in time of the aligned phase is
small between the traces and the sum traces shows an enhanced
signal to noise ratio, if the following conditions are met:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The slowness and azimuth values are properly determined.
  <LI>The assumption of a plane wave is applicable
  <LI>The dominant frequencies of the signal still allow coherency
</UL>

<P>This command is organized as a toggle function. Selecting once
performs delay and sum of the traces, selecting a second time
restores the original positions of the traces and deletes the
beam trace. With this operation the results of slowness determination
(by <A HREF="menu_plane_wave.html">Plane Wave</A> or by
<A HREF="menu_fk.html">FK</A>)
may be checked or an amplitude/magnitude measurement on the beam
trace may be performed.</P>

<P>This command needs the location of your recording stations
in the station information file (see <A HREF="statloc.html">How
to put station information into SH/SHM</A>). Required entries
are <em>lat</em> and <em>lon</em>, recommended is
<em>xrel</em>, <em>yrel</em> and <em>array</em>.
If the relative locations are not found in the file, SHM computes
it from the latitude and longitude. The algorithm used is very
simple might not be accurate enough.</P>
