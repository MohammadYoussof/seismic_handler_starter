<h2>How to use own stations in SHM</h2>

<ol>

   <li>
      <p>Insert station code and coordinates into <em>$SH_INPUTS/STATINF.DAT</em>
      (see <a href="statloc.html">How to put station information into SH/SHM</a>)
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>SHM version 2.4 and higher: edit your configuration file and modify/add
      a <em>v$read_dialog_stations_??</em> variable to list your stations.  E.g.
      if you have your stations ABC, XYZ, XXX then an appropriate line would be
      <em>v$read_dialog_stations_01 ABC,XYZ,XXX</em>.<br>
      SHM version prior to 2.4: Modify a <em>STATLIST</em>-file in
      <em>$SH_GLOBALS</em> and include the new stations so that you get a
      button to select for each. If you have only one <em>STATLIST</em>,
      this is <em>$SH_GLOBALS/STATLIST_DEFAULT.STX</em>.&nbsp; Read about
      <a href="menu_read.html">menu entry Read</a> on details.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>SHM version 2.4 and higher: edit your sensitivitiy file (by default
      this is $SH_INPUTS/sensitivities.txt and add appropriate lines for your
      stations.  E.g. if you have a station xyz with channels bh and components
      zne with a calibration of 1.2 (nm/s)/count this line should look
      like <br><em>xyz-bh-? ... ... 1.2</em><br>
      For details read the <a href="sensitivity_file.html">web page of the
      sensitivity file</a>.<br>
      SHM version prior to 2.4: create files
      <em>$SEED_INPUTS/seedcalib_&lt;station&gt;-&lt;chan&gt;-&lt;comp&gt;</em>
      (e.g. for a station <em>GRFO</em>
      create one file for each channel in <em>$SEED_INPUTS</em>:
      <em>seedcalib_grfo-bh-z</em>, <em>seedcalib_grfo-bh-n</em>,
      <em>seedcalib_grf-bh-e</em>,
      also for other channels like, <em>lh</em> or <em>hh</em> if necessary).
      In this file you put
      the time window where the calibration is valid and the calibration
      value into one line, you can add several lines, one for each time
      window. Have a look at the existing files as examples, a more elaborate
      example is e.g. <em>$SEED_INPUTS/seedcalib_gra1-bh-z</em>.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>Add the streams of this stations to the file
      <em>$SH_INPUTS/filter_lookup.txt</em>
      or create appropriate filter files in <em>$SH_FILTER</em>. Read about <a
      href="fil_simulation.html">working with simulation filters</a> for details.
      </p>
   </li>
