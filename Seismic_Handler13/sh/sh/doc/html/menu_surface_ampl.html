<H2>Menu entry <em>Surface-Ampl automatic</em></H2>

<P>Determine amplitude of surface wave on waveform. Surface amplitudes
are usually read from simulations of an SRO-LP instrument and
are attached to a pseudo-phase named L. The amplitude may be determined
like e.g. body wave magnitudes (on WWSSN-SP simulations) using
the menu entry <A HREF="menu_ampl_per_p.html">Ampl &amp; Period
auto Peak</A>. This means select a phase L on the z-component
of the surface wave train and proceed like for body waves. For
a following determination of a surface magnitude, however, the
period of the surface amplitude measurement is recommended to
range between 18s and 22s. This may cause repetitions of the above
operation until this period window is found. This menu entry automatically
finds the maximum amplitude in the required period range. You
just have to select the time window of the complete surface wave
train. Then an L phase is picked and its amplitude determined.</P>
