<H3>Compiling SH/SHM on Linux</H3>

<P>The only Linux distribution we use here is from SuSE. Other
distributions may have different locations of libraries and/or
include files.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>SH</P>

<P>The command line version SH compiles without problems if the
libraries are specified properly (please comment if you do not
agree).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>SHM</P>

<P>For SHM you need a Motif library included to your system. The
one we use is MetroLink Motif. It is not free, the CD &amp; license
costs about DM 280,-. For SuSE 6.x systems you need the most recent
MetroLink Motif 2.1, older versions did not work.</P>

<P>There are additional program packages (LocSAT and FK) which
can be called from menu entries of SHM. These packages are not
part of the SHM tar-file. These programs are at least partly written
in Fortran. For FK there is not yet a precompiled version for
Linux available, a Linux-version for <A HREF="ftp://www.szgrf.bgr.de/pub/software/locsat-linux.tar.gz">LocSAT</A>
is on our ftp server.</P>
