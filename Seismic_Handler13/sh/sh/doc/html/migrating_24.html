<H2>Migrating to SHM version 2.4</H2>
<P>SHM version 2.4 reveals significant differences in program
configuration. The reason for the changes were simplification and
homogenisation of program control. A number of separate parameter
files (like <I>window_configs.txt</I>, <I>list_of_analysts.txt</I> or
the <I>STATLIST_</I>...-files) together with the more or less cryptic
startup files containing parameter definitions have been replaced by
a text file of simple structure. This configuration text file may be
modified with any text editor. Subsets of parameters may be grouped
into separate files and may be referenced by the main parameter file.
Predefined parameter sets like colour or window geometry definitions
are provided and help to keep the parameter file more concise and
clear. The syntax of the parameter file is described in the
<A HREF="configuration-file.html">configuration file documentation</A>.
The station info file <I>$SH_INPUTS/STATINF.DAT</I> and the filter
lookup table <I>$SH_INPUTS/filter_lookup.txt</I> remain unchanged in
version 2.4, however the location of these files may be changed via
the configuration file so that each user can make SHM use his private
copies of them. The zoo of calibration files for MiniSEED formatted
files (<I>seedcalib_</I>... files) have been replaced by a single
text file, but SHM still supports the old style <I>seedcalib_</I>...-files
if desired.</P>
<P>The default parameter file is <I>$SH_INPUTS/shm-config.txt</I>,
but it is strongly recommended to create a private copy at a
different location (e.g. your home directory) and point to it with an
environment variable <I>SH_USER_PARAM</I> (<I>setenv SH_USER_PARAM
$HOME/my-shm-config.txt</I>). A later update of SHM will overwrite
all $SH_INPUTS/shm-conf* files and undo all the changes in the
default configuration file you may have done before. The private
configuration files provide the possibility for every user of SHM to
keep his personal preferences saved while working with the same SHM
installation as all other users of the system.</P>
<P>Further developments in version 2.4 are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Freely definable colours of windows (foreground and
	background) and dialog boxes.</P>
	<LI><P>Seismogram traces which have incomplete amplitude information
	or quality defects (documented in miniSEED quality flags) are marked
	with red alert colour</P>
	<LI><P>Automatic plugin download from the SZGRF web page</P>
	<LI><P>Plugin available for SHM source code update (automated source
	code download and compilation)</P>
</UL>

</P>
<P>To migrate from your version of SHM to version 2.4 please perform
the following steps:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Install version 2.4 using the installation script. Preferably
	install on a new directory to keep your current version as a backup.</P>
	<LI><P>Copy the configuration file <I>$SH_INPUTS/shm-config.txt</I>
	to a place of your choice, e.g. your home directory and point the
	environment variable <I>SH_USER_PARAM</I> to it (<I>cp
	$SH_INPUTS/shm-config.txt $HOME/my-shm-config.txt; setenv
	SH_USER_PARAM $HOME/my-shm-config.txt</I>).  Put this <I>setenv</I>
   definition to your .cshrc file to make it permanent.</P>
	<LI><P>Edit your configuration file <I>$SH_USER_PARAM</I>. It should
	find some introductory comment lines, a <I>file_version</I> entry
	and then two include statements to specify colours and geometry
	(e.g. <I>include shm-conf-brown-colours.txt</I> and <I>include
	shm-conf-sxga-geometry.txt</I>). The geometry is determined by the
	installation program automatically. Look for existing alternatives
	in <I>$SH_INPUTS/shm-conf-*.txt</I> if the geometry is not
	recognised properly or if you don't like the colours. Provided are
	geometry setups at least for the resolutions xga (1024x768 pixels),
	wxga (1280x800), sxga (1280x1024).</P>
	<LI><P>Put your <I>STATINF.DAT</I> and <I>filter_looup.txt</I> files from your
	previous version to version 2.4: either copy the files to the new
	<I>$SH_INPUTS</I> directory or change the parameters <I>station_info_file</I>
	and <I>filter_lookup_table</I> in your configuration file to have
	SHM find your files in other locations.</P>
	<LI><P>If you are working with MiniSEED files put your station names
	to the configuration file.  Use the <I>v$read_dialog_stations_??</I>
	variables to define an arbitrary number of dialog boxes.  If you
	have e.g. the stations ABC, XYZ and XXX then change the existing
	definition of <I>v$read_dialog_stations_01</I> to the value
	<I>ABC,XYZ,XXX</I>.  For a complete description of the possibilities
	of station definitions read the <A HREF="configuration-file.html">manual
	of the configuration file</A>.</P>
	<LI><P>If you are working with MiniSEED files, provide the
	calibration information for the new SHM version. First copy all
	<I>seedcalib_*</I> files from your old <I>$SEED_INPUTS</I> directory
	to your new (if you are using different installation trees). Then
	you have two choices: (1) just set the <I>sensitivity_file</I>
	parameter in your configuration file to <I>old-style</I> and
	continue working with your <I>seedcalib_*</I> files or, preferably,
	(2) call <I>$SH_UTIL/sensitivity_from_old_style.csh
	&gt;$SH_INPUTS/sensitivities.txt</I> and leave the <I>sensitivity_file</I>
	parameter unchanged on <I>default</I> or set it to the location of
	your new <I>sensitivities.txt</I> file.  Please read the syntax
	<A HREF="sensitivity_file.html">description of the
	sensitivities-file</A>.</P>
	<LI><P>If you have created own filter filter on <I>$SH_FILTER</I>,
	copy them from your old to your new filter directory, or simply copy
	all your filter files to the new filter directory (there was no
	change in filter design and naming conventions).</P>
	<LI><P>Set all other parameters of the configuration file according
	to your needs. Please read the <A HREF="configuration-file.html">configuration
	file documentation</A>.</P>
