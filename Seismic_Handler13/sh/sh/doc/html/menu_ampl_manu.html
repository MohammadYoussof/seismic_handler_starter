<H2>Menu entry <em>Ampl auto, Period manu</em></H2>

<P>Measure absolute amplitude on waveform. On some complex waveforms
the automatic determination of the signal period may not give
acceptable results (see commands <A HREF="menu_ampl_per_p.html">Ampl
&amp; Period auto Peak</A> and <A HREF="menu_ampl_per_z.html">Ampl
&amp; Period auto Zero</A>). Here you can select the signal period
directly by mouse using the left button, alike in the above commands.
The algorithm searches minimum and maximum within the given window,
half of their difference is used as plain amplitude. The period
is read as the length of the time window you have selected. The
dialog box popping up asks you for a multiplier of this selected
period. E.g. if you selected only half of the period, choose 2.
From the plain amplitude the absolute amplitudes of ground velocity
and ground displacement is estimated dividing by the transfer
function of the current simulation filter applied at the measured
period (see <A HREF="fil_simulation.html">Work with simulation
filters</A>). Amplitude determination works currently only after
application of simulation filters. The results of the amplitude
determination are written to the terminal window where SHM was
called or may be viewed with menu entry <em>Show Parameters</em>.</P>
