<H2>The phase dialog box</H2>
<P>This dialog box contains the elements phase name, sign and type of
onset, reliability of phase identification, type of event, quality
scaling and additional parameters. It is used for selecting
properties of a phase before picking it on a trace (using the left
mouse button). Once a phase has been picked, its properties cannot be
changed any more. The phase must be deleted (by double-clicking on
it) and defined again with changed properties. Clicking on a phase
copies all of its property settings into the phase dialog box. Phases
may be shifted in time just by dragging it with the left mouse
button.</P>
<H3>Phase name</H3>
<P>The phase name is defined by the editable text field in the upper
part of the dialog box. The name may be edited directly, any phase
name may be used, it is not checked by the program. For conveniency
the most common phases are available also in two option menus above
the text field, one for local phases and one for teleseismic phases.
The selected phase name from this option menus is copied into the
text field. The phase <em>beam</em>
is a special (pseudo-)phase which is used for array techniques<!--NOEDIT--><!--/NOEDIT-->.</P>
<H3>Sign of phase</H3>
<P>Three radio buttons below the phase name field select the sign of
the picked phase. <em>+</em>
is positive onset, <em>-</em>
is negative onset and <em>0</em>
is undefined onset (this is default).</P>
<H3>Onset Spec</H3>
<P>The type of onset is selected with this two radio buttons. <em>e</em>
stands for emergent onset (default), <em>i</em>
for impulsive.</P>
<H3>Reliability</H3>
<P>Here you can indicate how reliable your phase identification is. <em>y</em>
means the phase is identified reliably, <em>n</em>
means the phase name is a guess. In the second case the phase name
will be put in parantheses on all text output.</P>
<H3>Event type</H3>
<P>Selects type of source. Possible choices are <em>other</em>
(default), <em>mining</em>
(mining event), <em>blast</em>
(quarry blast), <em>nucl</em>
(nuclear explosion), <em>tele</em>
(teleseismic event), <em>regio</em>
(regional event), <em>local</em>
(local event).</P>
<H3>Quality factor</H3>
<P>This is an integer number between 1 and 9. Quality factor 1 means
very poor quality of phase, 9 means very good quality. Phases with
quality factor of 1 are not used for location processes.</P>
<H3>More - Onset Accuracy</H3>
<P>By default a phase selection just marks a time point on the trace,
there is no information about possible reading errors. This option
enables display or definition of available accuracy information. If
switched to <em>Query</em>
after each phase pick a time interval around this pick must be
indicated (also by left mouse click). A value of <em>Display</em>
just displays already available accuracy information.</P>
<H3>More - Event Publication</H3>
<P>Selects wether a phase should be marked for bulletin publication.
<em>Ignore</em>
means no phases are marked, <em>Telex
Ref-Station</em> means only phases of the reference station
are marked, <em>Telex All</em>
means all phases are marked.</P>
<H3>Button <em>Rename</em></H3>
<P>Used for renaming already picked phases.  The phase renaming has
to be done in two steps.  Put the name of the phases you want to
rename into the text edit field of the phase dialog box and click the
<em>Rename</em>
button.  All phases of the given name will change to <em>???</em>.
 Then put the new name of the phases into the text field and again
click <em>Rename</em>.
 All <em>???</em>
will change to the new name.  Please note that all phases having the
new name already before the renaming action will be deleted.</P>
<H3>Button <em>Del</em></H3>
<P>Deletes all phases with name given in the phase name text field.</P>
