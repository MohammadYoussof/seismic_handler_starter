SEISMIC HANDLER SHM
Beginner's manual

Seismic handler SHM (Motif version) is a program for routine analysis of
seismic data from an array or a network of stations. The data format
required is mini-seed, yet the program has capabilities of reading in
GSE.

The program has been written by Klaus Stammler of the Seismological Observatory
Graefenberg, Erlangen, Germany (em: klaus@szgrf.uni-erlangen.de)

This manual is not intended to be complete, as: 1) the author of this
manual is rather an SHM beginner, not an expert and 2) the author of
this manual uses SHM for a small network (4 stations SUW,WAR,OJC,KSP in
Poland), without accessing array and large network data. Therefore,
little if anything can be said here about array and location functions
of SHM. This manual is intended as an introduction to SHM.


1. Setup of SHM
================================
a. Environment variables.
   SHM uses a number of environment variables to move around a directory
   tree on a file system. The variables should be set in such a way as
   to avoid any symbolic links. SHM usually does not recognize such links
   and problems may result. The variables are:
   PWD - current directory.
   SEED_INPUTS - directory of calibration files
   SEED_PROG - directory of seed I/O utilities
   SFD - path to where are the data files.
   SH_COMMAND - directory of command procedures of SHM
   SH_COMMAND2 - the /bmp subdirectory of the above
   SH_ERRORS - directory of error files
   SH_EXTPROG - directory of external programs to be called from within SHM
   SH_FILTER - directory of filter files
   SH_GLOBALS - directory of network files and magnitude calculation files
   SH_HELP - help files should be here
   SH_INPUTS - directory of travel time tables, station lists
   SH_LIB - directory of SH libraries
   SH_ROOT - root directory of SH
   SH_SCRATCH - directory to put scratch files
   SH_SOURCE - directory of SH source files
   SH_TEXTEDIT - text editor to use by SHM
   SH_USERDIR - SH user directory
   SH_UTIL - directory of SHM utilities
   Other variables for advanced purposes:
   SH_LOCSAT, SH_LOCSAT_EXEC, SH_PDE, SH_RANLIB
   Some other variables are important during SHM installation:
   SH_CCOPTIONS, SH_COMPILER, SH_LINKLIBS, SH_LINKOPTIONS
   It is best to have these variables set in the user's .cshrc file.

b. Data preparation.
   SHM reads mini-seed files, with extensions BH? (broadband 20Hz), LH?
   (long period 1Hz) and HH (high frequency 80Hz). The files should be
   gathered in some directory. SHM needs a file  sfdlist.sfd  which
   determines what time segments are covered by each data file. This
   file must be created in the directory by:
      $SEED_PROG/sfdlist.csh '*.?H?' $PWD
   or (if there happen to be too many files):
      $SEED_PROG/sfdlist_l.csh '*.?H?' $PWD
   Attention: when there are symbolic links on the data directory tree,
    sometimes it may be necessary to manually setenv PWD to the current
    full absolute directory path before running sfdlist.
   Attention: once sfdlist is run, the SHM does not see any changes made
    to the directory (as of its contents). If a data file is added after
    the sfdlist command, SHM will not load this data. There is a solution
    to this problem: without exiting SHM, it is possible to run sfdlist
    from another terminal window - as long as it is run in the correct
    directory.

   Now we must setenv SFD to the path where are the data files (absolute
   path, no symbolic links), e.g.:   setenv SFD /data/sdat/1996/01
   We are now ready to start the SHM from a cmdtool or xterm window.
   Attention: if there happen to show many, many messages on the screen,
    there is probably something wrong with the SHM configuration and
    you should consult an expert of SHM.

c. Starting SHM
   To start SHM - assuming the env. variables are set up correctly and
   the sfdlist.sfd created - just type in the name of the program in any
   cmdtool or xterm window. The name of the program may be "shm", "SHM",
   or "shm_world", depending on the version. (To clear out: shm_world is
   a distribution version, shm is a test version, and SHM is usually the
   alias for shm_world).


2. The SHM screen
=================
SHM opens two windows and two boxes on startup. The main, largest window
is the TRACES window, at bottom right. Above it opens the MAGNIFIER window.
The two boxes at left are the DIALOG box containing the phase information,
and the PARAMETER box, containing the location information.
The windows on startup are empty, only the TRACES window has a menu:

File Work Window Array Locate Param Amplitude TraceList Save Specials.

Below this menu, if signals are loaded, SHM displays the time of the
position of the mouse, signal length and last command. If it doesn't,
there might be something wrong with the startup configuration, so consult
a specialist.

The SHM is mostly mouse-oriented. The left mouse button is used mainly
for phase picking and to pick items from the boxes and menus. The right
button serves to mark a trace fragment to be magnified in the MAGNIFIER
window. Seldom needed is the keyboard - mainly to write in non-standard
phases, extremely long time series length, write in external location
and origin time (if known), specifying an external filter or command.


3. Data input
=============
The main data format used by SHM is mini-seed.
>From the menu, choose "File" - press left mouse button and drag the mouse
onto "Read" and let go. A window opens, from which we choose by left mouse
button:
a) The stations to be read in.
b) The components to be read in.
c) Type of data to be read in (LH-1Hz, BH-20Hz, HH-80Hz)
d) Date & time of beginning of time series.
e) Length of the time series. When less than 60 minutes, move the mouse
   over the little horizontal bar and drag it left or right. When over
   60 minutes, click the left mouse button in the little window and in-
   put the number of minutes from the keyboard.
Usually that is all, so we click "Read New".
Attention: if this is not our first read in SHM, the program will not
 read in data unless we select "Work->Cancel parameters" before selecting
 "Read".
Attention: when during working with data you decide to read a longer/shorter
 fragment of data, or starting at a later/earlier time, do not cancel your
 parameters, but make changes in the "Read" window and finish with "Read
 Again".

Reading in GSE
--------------
The author of this manual has not had the chance to work with SHM on GSE data.
These data can be read in by "File -> Read GSE" or "File -> Read GSE2", de-
pending on whether the data are GSE or GSE2.


4. Scaling of traces, offset removal
====================================
The input traces may need scaling. The change of scaling is done by
selection of "Specials->Setup->normalization". Then we may choose:
c - constant for all traces
all(tot) - normalized to maximum amplitude on any trace within all traces
all(wdw) - normalized to maximum amplitude on any trace within the
           traces currently on display
single(tot) - normalized to maximum amplitude on each trace within
              its full length
single(wdw) - normalized to maximum amplitude on each trace within
              the visible window.
After selection, click on "Hide". The scaling type is remembered until
it is changed or until Quit from SHM.
The traces may be furtherly scales by use of the little "zoom" bar at
bottom of the PARAMETER box. Caution must be taken, one unit of "zoom"
means scaling by the factor of two.

The offset may be easily removed by chhosing "TraceList->Demean".

Similarly, spikes may be removed by "TraceList->Despike", however, these
must be real, electronic spikes, not banging of something in the vicinity
of the seismometer.

5. Use of filters
=================
To use filters, choose "Work->Filters". This opens a window with different
types of filters to use. Click on a little diamond left to choose a filter.
Some filters (Butterworths) need also some parameters like low bound and
high bound and filter order, also to be selected by mouse by clicking on
the little triangles near the values.
Choose a value for autocut to eliminate the rigning of the filter at the
beginning of the signal.
Use the "filter name" box to input an external filter name from the
keyboard, if needed (usually do not do anything in this box).
Having selected everything, click on "OK'.

To go back to unfiltered signals, choose "Work->Filters" and then click
on "none" and "OK".

Attention: After the filtration, the contents of the MAGNIFIER window
 remains unchanged until the first click of the right mouse button.

6. Magnifying a fragment of a trace
===================================
To magnify a trace fragment move the mouse onto the beginning of the
fragment, click the right button and drag the mouse right to the end
of the fragment. There, let go of the button. The marked fragment will
be shown in the MAGNIFIER window. Only one trace at a time may be
magnified.
a) To move the MAGNIFIER window on the trace, move the mouse into the
   center of the marked box on the TRACES window, click the right button,
   and drag.
b) To move the MAGNIFIER window from trace to trace, move the mouse onto
   the new trace and click once on the right button.
c) To change the width of the MAGNIFIER window, move the mouse onto the
   right limit of the marked box, click right button and drag left or
   right. At the desired width, let go. Then you may furtherly need to
   move the window, see p.6a.
d) To empty the MAGNIFIER window so the box marked on the TRACES window
   disappears (desired e.g. before printout!), choose
   "Window->Del_time_window".


7. Phase picking
================
Phases are picked by means of the left mouse button on the seismic traces.
This may be done on filtered or unfiltered signals, in TRACES as well as
in MAGNIFIER window. Of course, picks made in MAGNIFIER window are much
more accurate, so this is the place the picks should be made. Phases picked
in the MAGNIFIER window are at once displayed in the TRACES window and vice
versa.

After the click, the phase is marked with parameters as are currelty
displayed in the DIALOG box. Therefore, before you click, make sure these
parameters are correct. Select or check the:
a) Phase name (selected from one of two submenus after clicking on "local"
   or "tele". If needed, you can enter your own phase name into the little
   box which shows the current phase name. To do this, click on the box,
   and then use the keyboard.
b) The direction of first onset (+,- or 0). Of course this is relevant to
   P waves on vertical component only.
c) Onset type (emergent or impulsive). In case of impulsive P waves on the
   vertical component you should always give a non-zero direction of first
   onset.
d) Reliable - should be "y". Other choice does not make sense for networks,
   only for arrays.
e) Event type. Mark the event as local, regional, teleseismic, nuclear or
   blast.
f) "Quality" and "More" - leave unchanged.
At the bottom of the box there are three rectangles: Del, Fix and Hide.
Hide causes the DIALOG box to disappear. For the box to reappear, you
  must mark a phase (with the current parameters), and then try to delete
  it. Better do not use "Hide".
Del causes all the phases with parameters identical to the ones currently
  set in the box, to be deleted. This may be sometimes troublesome; if
  you have marked let's say, a PS phase on six traces and want to delete
  it from trace no. 4, you have to delete the phase (it disappears from
  all 6 traces!) and then pick it again on traces 1,2,3,5 and 6.
Fix - The purpose of this function is unknown.

SHM may help in phase identification, showing phase onsets calculated
from theoretical tables. See p.12 how to do this.

Attention: SHM does not accept two phases of identical name on the same
 trace.


8. Period and amplitude determination
=====================================
As the amplitude determination must be done on SRO-LP (or WWSSN_LP or
WWSSN_SP) filtered signals, you must first invoke the appropriate filter.
Don't worry. Your phase picks will remain unchanged, and you will be
able to go back to your current display after you have measured the
periods and amplitudes.
a) Choose "Work->Filter" and select SRO-LP (see p.5).
b) Mark the desired phase onsets or - in case of L waves, put phase
   marks just before the fragment on which you will take your measures.
   (It is best to do this in the MAGNIFIER window).
c) For each trace, choose "Amplitude->Ampl&Period_auto_peak". Then
   move the mouse onto the first maximum (or minimum) after the pick,
   click left button, move the mouse onto the next minimum (or maximum)
   and click again. The part of the signal will change color to show
   the measurement took effect. Repeat this for all desired traces.
d) After measuring the amplitudes and periods you may return to your
   original filtration (see p.5).

Attention: SHM checks if the measured parameters are correct; if not, it
will not save them and will give a warning about this only to the window
it was started from.


9. Results of SHM processing
============================
a) The results, as phase picks, measured amplitudes, locations, magnitudes,
   may be shown on the screen by means of "Work->Show Parameters". This
   invokes a texteditor, so we may, if we want, make changes to the report
   file using "Edit". You may now click on "File" by right mouse button and
   select:
   aa) Load file. Load another text file into the text editor. This makes
       little sense at this point.
   ab) Save current file. Save the current file to $SHSCRATCH/shm_number.evt
       This makes sense only if you have made changes to the file.
   ac) Store as New File. Save the file under new name to directory $PWD.
   ad) Include file. Merge a disk file with our current file.
   ae) Empty document.
  To exit texteditor, click right mouse button on the little triangle on
  the left of the top bar of the editor window. The choose "Quit". If you
  accidentally click on the left mouse button, you will iconify the text-
  editor, you must then double-click left on the icon, and then quit it
  by right mouse button.
  I haven't found useful purposes for the "View" and "Find" options of the
  texteditor.

b) Before you save your final parameters, it might be useful to input your
   comment to the event, such as: "Salomon Islands M=7.1", or "many spikes
   on the E component at WAR". To input a comment, choose "Work->Comment",
   or press a "v" with your mouse within the TRACES window. This invokes
   the texteditor, so you may input your comment. After you have written
   it in, click the right mouse button on "File" and select "Save current
   file". Then quit the texteditor by clicking on "File" and selecting
   "Quit".

c) The final parameters are written down when you choose "Work->Final
   Parameters" or by pressing "Ctrl-P" with your mouse within the TRACES
   window. This will write the complete information about the event and
   the phases picked to file shm_yymmddnnn.evt, where yy=year, mm=month
   dd=day, nnn=shm_generated_event_number, to directory as declared in
   shmsetup defpath_evtout statement in one of the startup files (see p. 14).
   This also invokes the texteditor, so you must click on its "File" and
   choose "Quit" to close it.

10. Exit from SHM
=================
To exit SHM for a moment it is best to iconify it (click left on the
triangle at the left side of the TRACES window top bar). To bring it back,
double-click left on the icon.
To totally quit SHM, choose first "Work->Cancel Parameters" and then "Quit".


11. Printouts
=============
Printouts are generated by pressing "Ctrl-H". Then you have to click left
mouse button in the TRACES or MAGNIFIER window (depending on the window of
which you desire the printout), to have it printed. The printout will
contain all the currently displayed phase picks, magnifier box, or other
stuff if present on the window. Of course, the default printer must be
configured on the machine.
There are two print modes, a fast mode and a slow quality mode. The quality
mode uses the sunview utility, so it does run only on machines with sun-
view installed and running. The quality mode also needs two other programs,
rasttopnm and pnmtops installed in the $SH_UTIL. The change of modes may be
done interactively by "Specials->Setup->Hardcopy" and choosing "fast" or
"quality". This may be also set up in one of the setup files (see p.14).


12. Theoretical phase calculation and display
=============================================
To have the SHM display the theoretical phase onsets, the little boxes
of source location and origin time in the PARAMETER box must be filled.
On an array or an extensive network, SHM may perform a location of its
own. In other case you have to supply the data manually, coming from
some other source of information (bulletin). You move your mouse onto
each little box, click left button, and input the data from the keyboard.
Before you actually write in the data, make sure there are no contents
left in the little box. If there is, delete it with the Backspace key.
On first write-in, SHM will ask for the source of your information; you
can input anything here (except leaving this space blank or supplying
spaces).
This way supply:
a. Latitude (negative if South)
b. Longitude (negative if West)
c. Depth in km
d. Date. The format of the date is: 23-jul-1996
e. Time. The format of the time is: 23:45:08.4
Now calculate the Azimuth and Distance. To do this, choose "Locate->
External Location".

Now calculate the theoretical phase onsets by "Locate->Theo(Tables)" or
by pressing "Ctrl-t" from the keyboard. A phase menu window opens up, from
which we choose the phases we want the SHM to mark. (You cannot mark the
phases shown in gray, as there are no tables available for these, if you
want to use them, first you must supply the theo tables for these phases
to SH_INPUTS.) SHM proposes the main phases to make the choice easier.
After choosing all the phases needed, click on O.K..
The calculation may take a moment, depending on the number and type of
phases chosen. The phases are then displayed on the screen. To get rid
of them, just press "Ctrl-d" (or you may choose "Locate->Del_Theo"). To
bring them back, press "Ctrl-t" (or "Locate->Theo(tables)") and click on
"O.K." (SHM remembers which phases have been chosen last time).

The theoretical phases may differ somewhat from the actual phases seen.
This is due to: location errors, origin time errors, discrepancies
between the travel time tables and actual travel times along a path
specific for a given event and observation point, and travel time inter-
polation when distance and source depth fall between two table entries.
Final phase determination should be performed manually, the theo_phase
utility is just for help.


13. Other options (not discussed above)
=======================================
a. File. There are also possibilities of reading in .GSE format files and
   external filters.
b. Work->Rotate. Rotation of seismograms to components pertaining to P, SV
    and SH waves. I guess you need to fill in the PARAMETER box to do this,
    similarly as for the theoretical phases.
   Work->Info_source. Specification of information source to be written into
    the "Final Parameters".
   Work->Parameter_Box. Clicking on this causes the PARAMETER box to disap-
    pear (if dispalyed) or reappear (if hidden).
c. Window. These options double the functions of the right mouse button in
    the TRACES window. The "Del_time_window" causes the MAGNIFIER window
    to be cleared and the box marking the fragment to be magnified to dis-
    appear.
d. Array. Here are the array options, which are not discussed in this
    beginner's manual.
e. Locate. Except the "->External Location" "->Theo_phases" and "Del_theo"
    discussed in p.12, other options need array or extensive network data,
    or some external files not supplied with SHM.
f. Param. I have not discovered the use of these options.
g. Amplitude. Used to determine the amplitudes, periods and magnitudes.
   The "Amplitude->Ampl&Period_auto_peak" is best to determine the ampl-
   itudes and periods (see p.8), but there are other choices you may
   experiment with.
h. Trace List.
   -> Demean - discussed in p.4.
   -> Delete. Delete the traces selected.
      To select the traces, move the mouse onto the trace number left of
      the trace, and click left button.
      After "delete", if you want to bring the traces back again, you
      must do "File->Read", then click on "Read_Again".
   -> Despike - discussed in p.4.
   -> Rm trend. Remove trend. Works similarly to "demean", only the
      method is different.
   -> Ref ml. I have not discovered the purpose.
   -> Hide Sel. Hide the traces selected. Works as delete, except that
      if you want to bring the traces back, just choose the option again.
   -> Hide Unsel. Works as Hide Sel, except that hides the traces NOT sel-
      ected.
   -> Sort Dist/Sort Azim - Putting the traces in order according to
      distance or azimuth vs. the source.
i. Save. I have not discovered the use of these options.
j. Specials. These options are rather seldom used by the SHM beginner. The
   most important of these is the "Setup". Here can be found the:
   -> Special commands. The instructions here depend on the contents of
      some configuration files. You can for example interactively change
      your seismic network here.
   -> Del Horiz. Delete horizontal components. Works as "Trace_List->Delete",
      except that it does not need trace selection. This command has a short-
      cut "Ctrl-O" from the keyboard.
   -> Screendump. A shortcut for this is "Ctrl-H", discussed in p.11.
   -> User Cmd. Gateway to give a user command. Advanced option.
   -> Command. Gateway to give an extra SH command. Advanced option.
   -> Setup:
     --> hardcopy fast / quality. Set type of printouts.
     --> max cursor. I haven't discovered the use of this.
     --> normalization - discussed in p.4.
     --> trace order. Display the traces with trace no.1 at the top or at
         the bottom. This can be also set in SHM_USER_STARTUP.SHC file
         as "shmsetup top_down_order true" or "...false". The "false" is
         the default.
     --> filter type. Rather an advanced option.
     --> default filter. If used, all the traces are filtered with this
         filter after being read and before being displayed.
     --> parameter list. I haven't discovered the use yet.
     --> phase names. I haven't discovered the use yet.


14. Elements of SHM configuration
=================================
The SHM to work needs a certain directory structure on the hard disk on the
computer, governed by the environment variables explained in p.1. Below some
of the elements of the configuration will be discussed.
A. User configuration.
   There are two configuration files:
   SH_COMMAND/SHM_CMD_STARTUP.SHC - standard configuration file
   SH_USERDIR/private/SHM_USER_STARTUP.SHC - user configuration file
   Both may have similar contents, but if both specify the same parameter,
   the value from the user config is taken. If the user config does not
   contain some parameter, the value of it is taken from the standard con-
   fig, if that does not specify it, default value is taken.
   The two files are executed only on startup of SHM.
   In the files, lines starting with "!" are comment lines and are ignored.
   Some of the contents:
   shmsetup prompt_analyst true - on startup, this prompts the analyst to
         identify himself.
   sdef tmp - define variable tmp
   @CALC s &TMP = \path_to\evid\ DOSLASH
   shmsetup defpath_evid "tmp - The two above lines define the path where
         SHM keeps track of event numbers used.
   @CALC s &TMP = \path_to\evtout\ DOSLASH
   shmsetup defpath_evtout "tmp - The two above lines define the path where
         Final Parameter files are to be written.
   shmsetup refstation suw - set reference station to 'SUW' (must be in
         the list!)
   shmsetup default_source igf - set default information source to 'igf'
   shmsetup dephault_phase_type tele_quake - after read, the event is
         qualified as teleseismic, until this qualification is changed in
         the DIALOG box (see p.7e).
   shmsetup default_filter name - prefiltration of signals, see p.13j
         (setup->default_filter)
   shmsetup default_depth_type preset - after read, a constant value will
         be put to "Depth" window in the PARAMETER box.
   shmsetup default_depth 33.0 - the above value is to be (in this
         case 33 km).
   shmsetup top_down_order true - order of traces on display. If true, trace
         1 is at the top, if false, it is at the bootm.
   shmsetup double_click_time 300 - double-click time for the mouse
   shmsetup color_mark 1.0,0.0,0.0 - color (rgb) of phase picks (here:red)
   shmsetup color_theo 0.0,0.0,1.0 - color of theo_phases (here:blue)
   shmsetup color_auto 1.0,0.0,1.0 - color of amp&period determ.(here:violet)
   shmsetup color_crsr 0.0,0.0,1.0 - color of cursor (here:blue)
   @SHMSETUP SCREENDUMP_PROC |"TMP|sd_xwd.csh| - set printout as fast.
   @SHMSETUP SCREENDUMP_PROC |"TMP|sd_screendump.csh| - set printout as
         quality. Attention: only one of the two above statements should
         appear in a config file. If there will be two, the first will be
         ignored.
   shmsetup defpath_data sfd - path to data files is given by the variable
         sfd.
   shm_cmd_norm sw - normalization of traces after read (here: sw=all channels
         separately, within the visible window).
   SHM_CMD_READ_DIALOG STATLIST_something.STX
         STATLIST_something.STX is the file containing the list of station
         codes belonging to the default network. The file is in directory
         SH_GLOBALS.
B. Directory SH_GLOBALS
   a. STATLIST_something.STX files contain the lists of station codes, be-
      longing to networks. If there are several networks possible, there
      will be several such files.
   b. refstation_list.stx - list of possible reference stations (maximum 5).
   c. Other files are used do determine magnitudes, filters and display
      colors.
C. Directory SH_FILTER
   Contains different filter definitions.
D. Directory SH_INPUTS
   a. *.TTT files are travel time tables for theoretical phase calculation.
   b. filter_lookup.txt. Definition of how different stations are to be
      filtered. If the station is not here, there may be problems with
      having it filtered.
   c. list_of_analysts.txt. List of ID's of analysts.
      (valid if shmsetup prompt_analyst true)
   d. STATINF.DAT - All possible station codes and locations throughout the
      world.
   e. STATLOC.DAT - Station codes and locations; this data is used in location
      procedures.
   f. Some other files of unknown purpose.
E. Directory SEED_INPUTS
   Among other files, there are the calibration files, e.g.:
   seedcalib_suw-bh-z , containing calibration data for station (SUW),
   trace type (bh=broadband), component (z).

15. Setbacks. These are few, but they do exist - as in almost every
software program. Those I found are:
- Enigmatic error communication: Error CL-06, with no further explanation.
- The "Help" usually doesn't give any help, at least in the current version.
- No possibility to integrate/differentiate signals.

This short manual has been written by Pawel Wiejacz of the Institute of
Geophysics, Polish Academy Of Sciences, em: pwiejacz@seismol1.igf.edu.pl ,
based on own experience with SHM.
