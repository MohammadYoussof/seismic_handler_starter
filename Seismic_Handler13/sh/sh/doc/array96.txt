Quick Guide to SH (Array Course 1996)
=====================================


General Remarks
---------------

- command line interpreter is not case-sensitive
- command line consists of command-verb, parameters and qualifiers
- separation characters are blanks " " or semicolons ";"
- qualifiers are preceded by a slash.
- delete scratch files in directory shscratch from time to time


Some Commands
-------------


- start SH
   SH

- open graphics window
   XOPEN;;              on X-Window system

- exiting from SH
   QUIT

- help
   HELP                 directory of (almost all) available commands
   HELP HELP            explanation of HELP command
   HELP/KEY             directory with brief description
   HELP/CALL            directory with calling syntax
   HELP <cmd>           detailed help on command <cmd>, example: HELP HELP

- read & write commands
	READS <path> <time> <seclength> <stations> <comps> <chan>
                        reads from Mini-SEED files (special SH subformat)
   READ <q-file> <list> reads data from q-file (private SH data format)
   WRITE <q-file> <list>
                        writes data to q-file

- redraw display
   RD                   redraws display
   NR                   disables automatic redrawing (re-enable with RD)

- set & delete time windows
   STW                  set time window
   DTW                  delete time window

- pick time position on traces
   TIME                 gives absolute and relative time, also difference
                        time to last pick, exit with "E"-key

- delete traces
   DEL <list>           deletes all traces of <list>

- shift traces
   SHIFT <list> <time>  shift all traces in <list> by <time> seconds
   SHIFT ALL TIME_AL    shift traces according to their position in absolute
                        time
   T-ALIGN              repositions all traces correct in time


- trace amplitudes
    NORM AF             default setting.  Traces are normalized to the maximum
                        value of all traces on the display
    NORM SF             all traces are displayed with the same amplitude
    ZOOM <list> <f>     all traces in <list> are amplified by a factor of <f>
                        this is independent from the NORM command

- filtering traces (FFT filters)
   FILI F <filter>      read in filter file (contains poles and zeroes)
   FILTER F <list>      filters list of traces
   MAKEF                calls external program to create filter files

- location of events
   LOCATE               computes azimuth and slowness for picked phase
                        exit with "E"-key
                        Traces MUST have the correct position in time !
                        ensure with the command T-ALIGN.

- beaming of traces
   DELAY+SUM <list> <a> <s>
                        shifts traces to align a phase coming from an azimuth
                        of <a> and a slowness of <s>.  Traces are aligned
                        in time automatically before operation.

- summing of traces
   SUM <list>           sums all traces specified in <list>

- hardcopy
   PHC                  creates PostScript file and sends it to laser printer
   TITLE <n> <t>        puts a title line on the display

- rotation of traces
   ROTAZ <list> <azim>  rotates horizontal traces to R and T

- particle motion diagrams
   PMSTART <wdwsize>    opens separate window of size <wdwsize> x <wdwsize> cm.
   PM/MWDW <list> <wd>  particle motion diagrams of N pairs of traces given by
                        2N elements in <list>.  <wd> is width of time window.
   PM3 <wd>             abbreviation of PM/MWDW 2,1,3,2,3,1 <wd>
                        if 3 traces are on the display, same for 6 and 9 traces
   PMEND                closes PM window
                        Before using the PM command, set an appropriate time
                        window with the STW command.

- utilities
   DEMEAN <list>        removes mean value
   TREND <list>         removes linear trend
   DESPIKE <list> <f>   removes spikes
   DECIMATE <list> <f>  decimate traces (average deleted samples)
   CUT <list> <lo> <hi> cuts traces at the specified time bounds
   MARK <trc> <time>    marks trace (marks can be labelled, see HELP MARK)
   SYSTEM               access to UNIX shell
   @                    execute single command case sensitive
