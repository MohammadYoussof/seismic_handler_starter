command NR
==========

key: switch redraw off

Switches automatic redraw off.  A NR command suppresses all display
redraws until a RD command is entered.  Each NR command must be
disabled by a separate RD command, that means if there are two
consecutive NR commands, then two RD commands are needed to cause
a redraw.
