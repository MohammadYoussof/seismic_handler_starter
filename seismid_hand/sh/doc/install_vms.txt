This is a VERY old file describing how the installation of SH used to be
on a VAX some time.  Since we changed our equipment to Sun/UNIX I never
tried it again to install the system on a VAX.  So this is definitely out
of date and VAX/VMS is not supported at all any more.

Installing SH
=============


   i)  copy all files of disk 1 into a separate directory (called main
       directory)

  ii)  copy all directories including their files of disk 2 into this main
       directory

 iii)  edit file SHSETUP.COM in the main directory and change the logical
       names to your actual pathnames.  The directories SHC_CURVES,
       SHC_QPROG, SHC_QLIST, SHC_LIB and SHC_VELOC are not important,
       so you can remove the definitions.

  iv)  edit the file BASECNST.H and remove the definition of BC_GRFVAX.

   v)  compile the source in the different directories.  There are command
       files in the directories SHC_MAIN (CC_SH.COM), SHC_GRAPHICS
       (CC_SHGRAPHICS.COM) and SHC_LOCAL (CC_SHLOCAL.COM).

  vi)  edit the link file SHLINK.COM in the main directory and remove the
       files SHMENU_GRF,DPET2,OFILEIN,K_FILE_IN,Y_FILE_IN,O_FILE_IO,TIMECNV,
       ABSZEIT,ERROR_MESSAGE,SYS_INPUT,IN_VLP_NEW from the link list.

 vii)  link SH using SHLINK.COM

viii)  run command file SHWORLD.COM

  ix)  try to start SH with the SHC command

   x)  open an X-Window using command XOPEN;; or an UIS-Window using VOPEN;;.
       THis window is used for graphic output.

  xi)  ...
