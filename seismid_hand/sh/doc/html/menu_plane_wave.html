<H2>Menu entry <em>Plane Wave</em></H2>

<P>Computes slowness and back azimuth from coherent phase picks.
It uses all phases of the name given in the <A HREF="phasebox.html">phase
dialog box</A>. It assumes that the incoming wavefront of that
phase is a plane wave. This algorithm is therefore applicable
only if the epicentral distance is much larger than the aperture
of the recording array and if the dominating frequencies of the
picked signal are in a range where coherency is still possible
(i.e. similar waveforms on the recording array). To check the
validity of this assumption is in the responsibility of the user.
Violation of these presuppositions may lead to nonsense results.
The algorithm determines the best fitting orientation of the wave
plane and parameterizes it by slowness and back-azimuth. The resulting
values are written to the <A HREF="parambox.html">analysis parameter
box</A>. Check the results with command <A HREF="menu_beam.html">Beam</A>.</P>

<P>This command needs the location of your recording stations
in the station information file (see <A HREF="statloc.html">How
to put station information into SH/SHM</A>). Required entries
are <em>lat</em> and <em>lon</em>, recommended is
<em>xrel</em>, <em>yrel</em> and <em>array</em>.
If the relative locations are not found in the file, SHM computes
it from the latitude and longitude. The algorithm used is very
simple might not be accurate enough.</P>
