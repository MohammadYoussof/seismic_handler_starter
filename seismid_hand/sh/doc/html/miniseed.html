<H2>Reading MiniSEED data into SH/SHM</H2>
<P>The MiniSEED format is a subformat of the commonly used SEED data
format (get a description of the SEED data format from <A HREF="http://www.iris.edu/">IRIS</A>).
It is well suited for continuous data sets or for archiving large
time spans of data. SH accesses MiniSEED data by start time and read
length and reads only part of the file rather than accepting a
filename and reading it completely (like in other formats e.g. GSE or
Q). SEED and even MiniSEED is a very flexible data format and allows
a great variety of subformat types. SH/SHM is not able to read
general MiniSEED, several restrictions apply:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">the data must be coded in Steim1
	or Steim2 compression</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">the data must be organised in
	separate files for each data stream 
	</P>
	<LI><P>the data must not contain records other than data records
	(that's what I understand as MiniSEED) 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The record length of the SEED records should be a power of 2. We work
with 4096 and 512 byte records, other record lengths are supported as well.
There are no naming conventions to be
matched for such MiniSEED files. Data are read in by specifying start
time, read length, station list, channel code and components. In
order to find the appropriate data file(s) for reading SH needs a
directory file which holds necessary information about location,
filename and content of a set of MiniSEED files. This file is usually
called <em>sfdfile.sfd</em>
and resides on the data directory or on any other location ('sfd'
stands for 'seed file directory'). SH/SHM can read only data which
are listed in such a file. Processing of online data in MiniSEED
format with SH needs an update of the sfdfile before. The SH package
contains a program to create <em>sfdfile.sfd</em>.
Its syntax is</P>
<P><em>sfdlist &lt;wild&gt;
&lt;dataroot&gt; [&lt;outfile&gt;] [&lt;quiet&gt;] [&lt;reclth&gt;]
[&lt;byteoff&gt;]</em></P>
<P>where</P>
<DL>
	<DD><em>&lt;wild&gt;</em>
	-- wildcard to match available data files in the data directory tree
	(e.g. <em>&quot;*&quot;</em>
	or <em>&quot;*.bh?&quot;</em>).
	Please mind the quotes. 
	</DD><DD>
	<em>&lt;dataroot&gt;</em>
	-- path to the root directory of the data files. It is recommended
	to specify here an absolute path (e.g. <em>$PWD</em>
	instead of <em>./</em>),
	since otherwise SH cannot find the data files if it is called from
	another directory. Also the resulting sfdfile cannot be moved to
	another location. 
	</DD><DD>
	<em>&lt;outfile&gt;</em>
	-- name of the output sfdfile, usually <em>sfdfile.sfd</em>
	(default) 
	</DD><DD>
	<em>&lt;quiet&gt;</em>
	-- if equal to <em>quiet</em>
	the processed files are not written to stdout 
	</DD><DD>
	<em>&lt;reclth&gt;</em>
	-- record length of SEED records, default is automatic detection 
	</DD><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.51cm">
	<em>&lt;byteoff&gt;</em>
	-- byte offset in MiniSEED file, the first <em>&lt;byteoff&gt;</em>
	bytes in the file are ignored, default is automatic detection. 
	</DD></DL>
<P>
The <em>sfdlist</em>
program searches the specified directory and all its subdirectories
for data files matching the given wildcard. If too many data files
exist in the data directory tree the program aborts with an error
message. In this case use the (slower) program <em>sfdlist_l</em>.
The commands <em>sfdlist</em>
and <em>sfdlist_l</em>
are aliases to the programs <em>$SEED_PROG/sfdlist.csh</em>
and <em>$SEED_PROG/sfdlist_l.csh</em>,
respectively. After the <em>sfdfile.sfd</em>
has been created SH can read in the data files listed. The
appropriate SH command (<em>reads</em>)
for reading MiniSEED data needs the location of the <em>sfdfile.sfd</em>.
Because of its VAX/VMS origin, SH does not distinguish between upper
and lowercase by default and has its own interpretation of slashes <em>/</em>
in the command line. Therefore it is a good idea to define an
environment variable pointing to your <em>sfdfile.sfd</em>
before using SH. This makes it a easier to specify the required
pathname within SH. E.g. if your sfdfile path is
<em>/home/gonzo/data/sfdfile.sfd</em>
use</P>
<P><em>setenv DATA /home/gonzo/data</em></P>
<P>to define the environment variable <em>DATA</em>.
Please mind the uppercase variable name and do not include the
<em>sfdfile.sfd</em>
itself to the definition. From within SH you may read in MiniSEED
data now using the command</P>
<P><em>reads &lt;sfdpath&gt;
&lt;start-time&gt; &lt;seclth&gt; &lt;stations&gt; &lt;comp&gt;
&lt;chan&gt;</em></P>
<P>where</P>
<DL>
	<DD><em>&lt;sfdpath&gt;</em>
	-- path to the <em>sfdfile.sfd</em>
	used. If a environment variable has been defined for this, give this
	name and append a colon <em>:</em>
	to it (e.g. <em>data:</em>).
	As mentioned before SH is not case sensitive (all characters are
	read as uppercase). 
	</DD><DD>
	<em>&lt;start-time&gt;</em>
	-- start time for reading in <A HREF="timeformat.html">SH
	time format</A> 
	</DD><DD>
	<em>&lt;seclth&gt;</em>
	-- number of seconds to read in 
	</DD><DD>
	<em>&lt;stations&gt;</em>
	-- station list. Separate the names by commas if more than one
	station. Do not use blanks between stations (e.g. <em>bfo</em>
	or <em>bfo,brg,wet</em>).
		</DD><DD>
	<em>&lt;comp&gt;</em>
	-- component list. One or more component can be specified. Just
	concatenate the component names or separate with commas (e.g. <em>z</em>
	or <em>zne</em>
	or <em>z,n,e</em>)
		</DD><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.51cm">
	<em>&lt;chan&gt;</em>
	-- channel to read (e.g. <em>bh</em>)
		</DD></DL>
<P>
SHM has no command lines, all parameters are controlled by the
<A HREF="menu_read.html">Read
dialog box.</A> The <em>&lt;sfdpath&gt;</em>
parameter is specified in the textfield in the lower right corner.
The colon after the environment variable name may be omitted here.
All other settings are done by mouse clicks and should be
self-explaining.</P>
<P>Complete SEED volumes may be read in using the program
<em>$SEED_PROG/seed2sfd</em>,
provided in recent SH/SHM distributions.  It creates an <em>sfdfile.sfd</em>
appropriate to read in data directly from the SEED volume (encoded in Steim1
or Steim2).
Older SH/SHM versions need to split up SEED volumes into MiniSEED files
using the program <em>$SEED_PROG/split_seed
&lt;seedvolume&gt;</em>. The resulting <em>miniseed_*</em>
files are MiniSEED formatted and can be read in as described above.
The <em>split_seed</em>
program can be used also for multiplexed MiniSEED files.</P>

<P>SH/SHM read in the data from MiniSEED which is usually given in
counts. To have access to true amplitudes you need to apply a calibration
gain multiplied to the sample counts.  From version SHM-2.4 on this information
is provided in a sensitivity file specified in the global setup file (by default
this is <em>$SH_INPUTS/sensitivities.txt</em>).  For details about this file
see the <a href="sensitivity_file.html">syntax of the sensitivity file</a>.
</P>

<P><b>Specification of calibration gain in older versions of SH/SHM</b><br>
SH/SHM versions prior to 2.4 need a file
<em>$SEED_INPUTS/seedcalib_&lt;station&gt;-&lt;chan&gt;-&lt;comp&gt;</em>
for each stream. The files are formatted as text lines of the form
<em>&lt;start&gt; &lt;end&gt;
&lt;calib&gt;</em>. <em>&lt;start&gt;</em>
and <em>&lt;end&gt;</em>
are beginning and end dates (in <A HREF="timeformat.html">SH
time format</A>) where <em>&lt;calib&gt;</em>
is valid. <em>&lt;calib&gt;</em>
is a floating point number and is multiplied to the counts when
reading the data from the MiniSEED file. If no calibration file is
found or no time window of the calibration file matches the start
time of the data, a message is displayed and a calibration value of
1.0 is used (i.e. counts remain unchanged).</P>
