<H2>Menu entry <em>Filter</em></H2>

<P>Applies filter to traces on display. The filter dialog box
opens to offer available filters. A description of the
elements of the filter dialog box follows below. After clicking
on <em>OK</em> the filtering is done on all traces of the display if
no traces have been selected before (may take some time, depending on
number and length of traces and on the CPU power of the host). The resulting
traces are displayed on screen. The original traces remain in memory
but are not visible any more. When the filter is changed, the
previously computed filter output traces are deleted and a new filter
operation is started using the original traces. Deselecting the filters (filter
<em>None</em>) restores
the original (unfiltered) traces on screen. Once a filter is selected in
remains active until it is explicitly switched off in the filter dialog
box or a <em>Read New</em>
is executed (see command <A HREF="menu_read.html">Read</A>).
<em>Read Again</em> keeps the
filter, that means the traces read in are filtered automatically.</P>

<P>SHM knows three kinds of filters, FFT filters, recursive filters and
tabulated filters.  While tabulated filters should be used only under special
circumstances, filter operations described here may be performed with either
of the other two types. Practically there are some contraints, however.
In general, the recursive filters are faster in computation time, in particular
for long traces. The computation time for recursive filters grows
linearly with the number of sample points, N, while the FFT filters
need time proportional to N*log(N), due to the FFT operation.
In some cases the FFT filters turn out to be numerically more
stable than recursive ones. FFT filters have one filter file for
all possible sample rates of the input traces, recursive filters
need a separate file for each rate (see <A HREF="fil_format.html">filter
files</A> of SHM). The program package supplies utility programs
to create FFT/recursive filters for several standard filters,
special filters have to be created manually by the user. In general,
creating FFT filter files is much easier than computing recursive
filter coefficients.</P>

<P>
<b>This paragraph applies to SHM version 2.4e and later only:</b>  If one or more
traces have been selected (by left-clicking on the station name or number)
before calling the filter dialog box, it opens
up with a restricted list of available filters.  The chosen filter (usually
a Butterworth highpass, lowpass or bandpass) then
is applied to the selected traces only and remains active as an additional
filter to these traces until it is switched off explicitely.  This is useful
e.g. for noisy traces to cut out the noise signals in addition to simulation
filters applied.  But be aware that such an additional Butterworth may change
the simulation filtering severely and affect amplitude measurements on simulated
seismograms.  To mark such traces with additional Butterworth filters visually,
they are displayed in a different colour (controlled by configuration parameters
<I>colour_addfil_red</I>, <I>colour_addfil_green</I>, <I>colour_addfil_blue</I>,
default is dark violet).  Different additional filters may be chosen for
different traces.  To switch off additional filters select the appropriate
traces again and choose no filter (<I>None</I>) in the filter dialog box.

<H3>The filter dialog box</H3>

<P>This dialog box has the following elements</P>

<UL>
  <LI>List of radio buttons with available filters.
  <em>None</em> switches of the filter option,
  all other selections set a new filter. A description of the filters
  follows.
  <LI>Corner frequencies and order of filter. This refers only
  to Butterworth Bandpass (BP), Lowpass (LP), and Highpass (HP)
  filters. BP reads <em>lower
  bound</em>, <em>upper
  bound</em> and <em>order</em>,
  LP reads <em>lower bound</em>
  and <em>order</em>, HP
  reads <em>upper bound</em>
  and <em>order</em>. On
  all other filter selections these values have no meaning.
  <LI>Name of the filter. Is set automatically when a filter is selected.
  When selecting filter <em>Other</em> this field has to be edited manually
  (this option is not tested very well).
  <LI><em>autocut</em> value
  option box. Usually filtered traces start with ringing at the
  beginning of the trace, caused by the discontinuity at the beginning
  of the input trace. The length of this filter noise depends on
  the dominant frequency of the filter. The length given here is cut off
  from each filtered trace so that the ringing does not appear
  on the screen. Known bug: this causes a shift of the time window
  selected by <A HREF="window_op.html">Set Time Window</A>.
</UL>

<H3>List of available filters</H3>

<UL>
  <LI><em>None</em>: switches
  off the filter option (see above).
  <LI><em>Standard BP</em>:
  Despite the name this is a simulation filter emulating a GRF
  record with BP from 0.8 to 2.2 Hz.
  <LI><em>WWSSN-SP</em>:
  simulation filter of this standard instrument
  <LI><em>LRSM-SP</em>:
  simulation filter, useful for more highfrequent signals
  <LI><em>Wood-Anderson</em>:
  simulation filter, mainly used for magnitude determinations
  <LI><em>KIRNOS</em>: simulation
  filter, similar to displacement
  <LI><em>SRO-LP</em>: simulation
  filter, useful for signals of long periods, surface waves
  <LI><em>WWSSN-LP</em>:
  simulation filter, not as longperiodic as SRO-LP
  <LI><em>LRSM-LP</em>:
  simulation filter
  <LI><em>Butterworth BP</em>:
  Butterworth Bandpass, see above
  <LI><em>Butterworth LP</em>:
  Butterworth Lowpass, see above
  <LI><em>Butterworth HP</em>:
  Butterworth Highpass, see above
  <LI><em>Other</em>: manual
  filter preparation, not really tested, for experts only

<P>Whether SHM uses FFT or recursive filters may be set (temporarily)
in <A HREF="menu_setup.html">Setup</A> (parameter
<em>filter type</em>) or (permanently) in <A
HREF="menu_configure.html">Configure</A> (in SHM version prior to 2.4 it is
parameter number 30, values <em>true</em> or
<em>false</em>, in version 2.4 and later it is the configuration file parameter
<I>filter_type</I>). The <em>Read New</em> option of
command <A HREF="menu_read.html">Read</A> can apply a default
filter after reading a new data set automatically. This also may
be changed in <A HREF="menu_setup.html">Setup</A> (parameter 
<em>default filter</em>) or
<A HREF="menu_configure.html">Configure</A> (in SHM version prior to 2.4 it is
parameter number 38, example filter <em>s+standard_bp</em>,
no filter means here <em>;;</em>, in SHM version 2,4 or later this is set in
the configuration file, parameter <I>default_filter</I>).</P>
