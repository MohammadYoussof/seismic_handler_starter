<H2>Format of filter files</H2>

<P>The filter files are line oriented, that means there is one
information entry per line. Blank lines are not allowed ! The
format of the filter files is as follows:</P>

<H3>FFT filter</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>All lines at the beginning of the file starting with exclamation
  sign <em>!</em> are comments
  and ignored by the program.
  <LI>The first data line is a magic number and must be <em>1357913578</em>
  <LI>The next data line contains the number <em>1</em>,
  which is an ID for FFT filters.
  <LI>Normalization value (real number), which is multiplied to
  the output samples of the filter.
  <LI>Number of zeros z (integer)
  <LI>z lines following with one zero each in the format
  <em>(&lt;real-part&gt;,&lt;imag-part&gt;)</em>.
  Both parts of a complex conjugate pair must be specified.
  <LI>Number of poles p
  <LI>p lines following with one pole each in the same format as
  zeros.
</UL>

<H3>Recursive filters</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>All lines at the beginning of the file starting with exclamation
  sign <em>!</em> are comments
  and ignored by the program.
  <LI>The first data line is a magic number and must be <em>1357913578</em>.
  <LI>The next data line contains the number <em>3</em>,
  which is an ID for recursive filters.
  <LI>Sample rate for which this file is valid (real number)
  <LI>Normalization value (real number), which is multiplied to
  the output samples of the filter.
  <LI>Number of numerator coefficients n (integer)
  <LI>n lines following, one coefficient (real number) in each.
  <LI>Number of denominator coefficients d (integer)
  <LI>d lines following, one coefficient per line.
  <LI>Optional following other stages of the filter, new stage
  indicated by a line containing a single <em>@</em>.
  <LI>Additional stages are repeating the entries 'ID number
  <em>3</em>' until denominator
  coefficients.
