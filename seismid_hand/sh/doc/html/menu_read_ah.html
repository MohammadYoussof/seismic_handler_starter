<H2>Menu entry <em>Read AH</em></H2>

This option is available only if a suitable library <em>libahaio.a</em> for
your system is present in
<em>$SH_LIB</em> and the compiler switch <em>SH_SETUP_AH</em> is set at
compilation time.

<P>Reads in AH data files. A file selection box pops
up to let the user select the data file. The default path in the
selection box may be changed in <A HREF="menu_configure.html">Configure</A>
(parameter number 10). After selecting the
file, all traces of the file are read in. By default all previously
read traces are deleted before reading a new AH file. To keep
traces when reading new ones switch on the <em>Keep Traces</em>
button in the <A HREF="menu_read.html">Read</A>
dialog box (this is not straightforward, I admit).</P>

<h3>Important:</h3>
Please note that all traces read with this function are multiplied with a factor
of 2*pi.  When working with velocity proportional data this ensures that the
data are scaled to nm/s if the reference frequency is 1Hz.  For other data
this is maybe not wanted.  This change this behaviour edit the file
<em>$SH_COMMAND/READAH.SHC</em>.
