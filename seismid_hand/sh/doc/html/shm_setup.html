<H2>SHM setup file</H2>

<P>
Since version 2.4 the parameters of SHM are maintained in a setup text
file, by default this is located in <em>$SH_INPUTS/shm-config.txt</em>.
If an environment variable named <em>$SH_USER_PARAM</em> is defined and
points to an existing file this takes precedence.  The data lines of this
file are of the simple structure</P>
<P>
<em>&lt;keyword&gt; &lt;value&gt;</em>
</P>
<P>
where neither <em>&lt;keyword&gt;</em> nor <em>&lt;value&gt;</em> may
contain blanks.  Please look in the file
<em>$SH_INPUTS/shm-config-default.txt</em>
for a complete list and explanation of possible parameters.  All keywords are
predefined and hardwired in the program code except keywords starting with
<em>v$</em>.  These <em>v$</em>-keywords are used for defining the station
button names of the MiniSEED read dialog box.  Entries like
<em>v$read_dialog_stations_01</em>, <em>v$read_dialog_stations_02</em>, ...
and so on are used for defining up to 99 different read dialog boxes.  The
corresponding value is a list of up to 32 comma-separated (no blanks) button
names.  Names 1-30 label the 30 station buttons, elements 31 and 32 give
names to the two subset buttons of the dialog box.  Two subsets of buttons
may be grouped using brackets in the comma list and can be selected/deselected
using the subset buttons.  Example:
</P>
<P><em>v$read_dialog_stations_01 [abc,bcd,cde],---,---,[xyz,xxx,yyy,zzz]</em>
</P>
<P>
In this case the first three and last four button can be selected together with
the first and second subset button, respectively.  Names consisting of
three hyphens (<em>---</em>) result in not selectable buttons.
Names starting with a
<em>$</em> refer to a corresponding <em>v$</em>-station list variable
holding the names of a station set.  Example:
</P>
<P><em>
v$read_dialog_stations_02 $net1,$net2,xyz,abc<br>
v$net1   n1a,n1b,n1c,n1d,n1e,n1f,nxx<br>
v$net2   n2x,n2y,n2z,nxx
</em></P>
<P>
In this case a click on the <em>$net1</em>-button selects the stations
<em>n1a,n1b,n1c,n1d,n1e,n1f,nxx</em> together.  More than one station list
button may be combined and selected, resulting stations lists are merged and
possible double selections are corrected, like station <em>nxx</em> in above
example if <em>$net1</em> and <em>$net2</em> are both selected.
</P>
<P>
Please have a look in the <em>$SH_INPUTS/shm-config-default.txt</em> file
to see more examples.
