<H2>Measuring amplitudes in SHM</H2>

<P>Determination of displacement amplitudes is an important part
in routine analysis of waveforms. Since true ground motion has
to be estimated, the transfer function of the recording instrument
must be taken into account. In former times only narrow-banded
instruments were available. From such records amplitudes and magnitudes
were determined. For reasons of continuity the common magnitude
determinations still use simulations of such historical standard
instruments. The body wave magnitude mb is read from WWSSN-SP
records, the surface wave magnitude Ms from SRO-LP and the local
magnitude Ml from Wood-Anderson simulations. Together with the
amplitude of the recorded (or better: simulated) signal also its
period must be estimated. Dividing the signal amplitude by the
value of the transfer function at the given period gives a rough
estimation of the ground motion at this period.</P>

<P>In order to perform this operations the transfer function of
the recording system must be presented to SHM in some form. The
way it is implemented is via an FFT filter file (.FLF-file). For
each simulated instrument which will be used for amplitude determination
such a filter file must exist in <em>$SH_FILTER</em>.
The naming convention is <em>TF_DSP_S+&lt;instrname&gt;.FLF</em>
(e.g. <em>TF_DSP_S+SRO_LP.FLF</em>,
for <em>SRO-LP</em> instruments).
If also <em>TF_VEL_S+&lt;instrname&gt;.FLF</em>
is specified (the velocity transfer function, which differs by
an integration from the <em>DSP</em>-version)
the velocity amplitude is additionally computed. If the record
has been created by a simulation filter, the transfer function
has been already used in this simulation filter (see <A HREF="fil_simulation.html">Working
with simulation filters</A>). That means the same transfer function
that went into the simulation filter (which was there multiplied
with the inverse of the recording system) is the content of these
<em>TF_DSP_S+&lt;instrname&gt;.FLF</em>
and <em>TF_VEL_S+&lt;instrname&gt;.FLF</em>
files.</P>

<P>Please have a look at the existing files in
<em>$SH_FILTER</em>. For example a set of files
is <em>TF_DSP_S+WWSSN_LP.FLF</em>,
<em>TF_VEL_S+WWSSN_LP.FLF</em>,
<em>TF_VEL_GRSN.FLF</em>,
<em>GRSN_S+WWSSN_LP.FLF</em>.
You may also view such files with the <A HREF="fil_graphics.html">filter
display</A> option.</P>
