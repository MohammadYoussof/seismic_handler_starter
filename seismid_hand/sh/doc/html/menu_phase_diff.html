<H2>Menu entry <em>Phase Diff</em></H2>

<P>Computes epicentral distance using travel time differences
between pairs of phases. SHM needs to know which phase pairs should
be processed if available. This phase pair list must be specified
in the Configure option> (parameter
number 3). Changing the list given here means to retype the complete
list including or excluding your changes. Please check for typos
and do not use blanks in the list, just separate the phases within
the pair with hyphens and the pairs with commas. Phase pairs not
listed here are not processed for distance determination. Selecting
<em>Phase Diff</em> makes
SHM scan all traces for such phase pairs. Each phase pair is assigned
a distance by fitting the travel time difference using the travel
time tables in <em>$SH_INPUTS</em>.
All distances found are averaged and the mean distance is written
to the <A HREF="parambox.html">analysis parameter box</A>.</P>

<P>Known bug: a phase pair has to be selected on the same trace,
a P on Z and an S on E are not recognized as a pair. Workaround:
select S temporarily also on Z and delete it after the depth determination.</P>
