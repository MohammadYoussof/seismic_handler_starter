<H2>Window operations</H2>

<P>The commands of the menu title Window allow manipulations of
the time window set in the main display. Please keep in mind that
traces of finite length are read into memory. If you move outside
the read interval with the window operations you get an (at least
partly) empty display. A reread of your traces might be necessary
then. A description of the commands follows.</P>

<DL>
  <DT><A NAME="Anker2408454"></A><em>Set
  Time Window</em>
  <DT>Takes over the time window selected by the right mouse button
  into the main display window. The time window remains active
  until it is reset by another <em>Set
  Time Window</em>, deleted by <em>Del
  Time Window</em> or new traces are read in.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><A NAME="Anker2705672"></A><em>Del
  Time Window</em>
  <DT>Deletes a time window previously set by
  <em>Set Time Window</em> and displays the complete
  traces as after the read operation.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><A NAME="Anker2705895"></A><em>Move
  Right</em>
  <DT>Moves a previously defined time window to the right by 50%
  of the display width. If you move outside the read interval the
  display is (partly) empty.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><A NAME="Anker2706192"></A><em>Move
  Left</em>
  <DT>Moves a previously defined time window to the left by 50%
  of the display width. If you move outside the read interval the
  display is (partly) empty.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><A NAME="Anker2706439"></A><em>Grow
  Right</em>
  <DT>Grows a previously defined time window to the right by 50%
  of the display width. If you move outside the read interval the
  display is (partly) empty.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><A NAME="Anker2706664"></A><em>Grow
  Left</em>
  <DT>Grows a previously defined time window to the left by 50%
  of the display width. If you move outside the read interval the
  display is (partly) empty.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><A NAME="Anker2711916"></A><em>3
  Zoom Traces</em>
  <DT>Displays all three components of a station in the zoom window
  in different colors, if the z,n,e components were read in before.
  The reference trace (this with the time window on it) is shown
  in the center. This is a toggle switch. Selecting again switches
  back to the single trace display.
