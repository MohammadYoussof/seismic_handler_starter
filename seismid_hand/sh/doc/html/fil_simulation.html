<H2>Working with simulation filters</H2>
<P>Simulation filters transform records of an instrument, preferably
a broadband instrument, into a simulated record of another
instrument. Before generating such simulation filters it should be
cleared whether the transfer function of the recording instrument
allows the simulation of the desired one. The recording system must
provide enough signal energy in all frequency ranges of the simulated
instrument. E.g. from records of STS-2 seismometers simulations of
short- and longperiod instruments like WWSSN-SP and SRO-LP may be
computed, but inversely, e.g. from WWSSN-SP to STS-1 is definitely
not possible. In principle, the construction of simulation filters is
rather simple if we use the poles-and-zeros definition of filters.
These numbers can be directly written into an SH-FFT-filter file (see
<A HREF="fil_format.html">filter formats</A>). A simulation filter is
created by taking the transfer function of the recording instrument
(e.g. an <A HREF="fil_tf_vel_sts2.html">STS-2</A>), inverting it
(take reciprocal value of the normalization, exchange poles and
zeros), multiply it with the transfer function of the simulated
instrument (e.g. <A HREF="fil_tf_vel_wwssn_sp.html">WWSSN-SP</A>) and
shorten all possible values of the rational expression. The resulting
filter (example: <A HREF="fil_sts2_to_wwssn_sp.html">STS2-to-WWSSN-SP</A>)
may be used for application in SHM. Please make sure that all
elements (normalization constants, poles-and-zeros definition of the
filter) refer to the same recording input (usually either velocity or
displacement). In practice, this is quite often a reason for
confusion. For a quick view of the amplitude response of your FFT
filters use <A HREF="fil_graphics.html">graphic display of FFT
filters</A>. If you want to create recursive simulation filters, use
the utility programs of SH/SHM (in <em>$SH_UTIL</em>,
programs <em>butrec</em>,
<em>simrec</em>)
for some standard cases or follow instructions for computing
recursive filters given e.g. in ???.  A <A HREF="fil_create_simset.html" NAME="create simset">tool</A>
for creating a set of FFT filters for your recording equipment is
provided in <em>$SH_UTIL</em>.</P>
<P>When using SHM, the filter files need to match a naming convention
so that the files can be found on request. The filter files must be
located either in <em>$PWD</em>
or in <em>$SH_FILTER</em>.
Looking for the filter files SHM assumes file names of a defined
format:</P>
<P>FFT-files: <em>&lt;rec-instr&gt;_S+&lt;sim-filter&gt;.FLF</em></P>
<DL>
	<DD><em>&lt;rec-instr&gt;</em>
	Descriptor of the recording instrument. By default this is
	<em>&lt;station&gt;:&lt;channel&gt;:&lt;comp&gt;</em>
		</DD><DD>
	<em>&lt;station&gt;</em>
	Station name (examples: <em>BFO</em>,
	<em>GEC2</em>) 
	</DD><DD>
	<em>&lt;channel&gt;</em>
	2-character SEED channel code (examples: <em>BH</em>,
	<em>HH</em>) 
	</DD><DD>
	<em>&lt;comp&gt;</em>
	Component (examples: <em>Z</em>,
	<em>N</em>) 
	</DD><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	<em>&lt;sim-filter&gt;</em>
	Descriptor of simulated instrument (examples: <em>WOODAND</em>,
	<em>G_WWSSN_SP</em>)
		</DD></DL>
<P>
recursive files: <em>&lt;smprate&gt;HZ_&lt;rec-instr&gt;_S+&lt;sim-filter&gt;.FLR</em></P>
<DL>
	<DD><em>&lt;smprate&gt;</em>
	Integer sample rate in Hz (examples: <em>20</em>,
	<em>40</em>) 
	</DD><DD>
	<em>&lt;rec-instr&gt;</em>
	See above 
	</DD><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	<em>&lt;sim-filter&gt;</em>
	See above 
	</DD></DL>
<P>
All filenames must have uppercase letter only ! Hyphens in filter
filenames are not supported by SHM. As an example, a legal filename
for an FFT simulation filter for <em>WWSSN-LP</em>
recorded at station <em>RAR-BH-Z</em>
would be <em>RAR:BH:Z_S+WWSSN_LP.FLF</em>.
Since it is rather inconvenient to have separate filter files for
each stream, it is possible to combine several streams to a single
class name within a lookup table. Class names found in the lookup
table replace the individual stream names within the filenames. SHM
searches two lookup tables: an internal table (implemented in the
source code) and an external table in the file
<em>$SH_INPUTS/filter_lookup.txt</em>.
The internal table maps all GRF-BH-streams (e.g. <em>GRA1-BH-Z</em>,
<em>GRB1-BH-N</em>)
to the name <em>GRF</em>,
all GRSN-BH-streams (e.g. <em>BFO-BH-Z</em>,
<em>CLZ-BH-E</em>)
to the name <em>GRSN</em>
and all GERESS-HH-streams (e.g. <em>GEA0-HH-Z</em>)
to the name <em>GERESS</em>.
Due to this lookup table the simulation filter for <em>WWSSN-LP</em>
on stream <em>BFO-BH-Z</em>
is <em>GRSN_S+WWSSN_LP.FLF</em>
instead of <em>BFO:BH:Z_S+WWSSN_LP.FLF</em>.
In the external lookup table arbitrary mappings of additional
stations can be added. For example if you have two stations <em>XYZ</em>
and <em>XXX</em>,
both with an instrument <em>CMG40T</em>
which has the same transfer function for all three components then
you should add the lines</P>
<DL>
	<DD>
	<em>XYZ-BH-Z CMG40T</em></DD><DD>
	<em>XYZ-BH-N CMG40T</em></DD><DD>
	<em>XYZ-BH-E CMG40T</em></DD><DD>
	<em>XXX-BH-Z CMG40T</em></DD><DD>
	<em>XXX-BH-N CMG40T</em></DD><DD>
	<em>XXX-BH-E CMG40T</em></DD>
</DL>
<P>
to the external table. Then the appropriate simulation filter for
<em>WWSSN-LP</em>
would be <em>CMG40T_S+WWSSN_LP.FLF</em>.</P>

<P>
The general systax of a line in <em>filter_lookup.txt</em> is since version
SHM-2.2f:
<DL>
	<DD>
		<em>&lt;chan&gt; &lt;filname&gt; [[&lt;stime&gt; &lt;etime&gt;] &lt;flags&gt;]</em>
	</DD>
</DL>
where <em>&lt;chan&gt;</em> is the channel string (like <em>XYZ-BH-Z</em> in
example above), <em>&lt;filname&gt;</em> is the name given to the filter
(like <em>CMG40T</em> in the example above), <em>&lt;stime&gt;</em> and
<em>&lt;etime&gt;</em> specifies the valid time window (start and end time
in <a href="timeformat.html">SH time format</a>) of the information given in
this line.  Three dots (...) as time value indicate an empty time, which
means no time boundary. If the equipment at a station site changes at some time a new
entry for this station has to be added in <em>filter_lookup.txt</em>.
<em>&lt;flags&gt;</em> may contain the following strings:
</P>
<DL>
	<DD>
	<em>-FORCETAB-</em> indicates that the simulation filters of this station
   are given as tabulated (FAP) filter files (.FLT-files).  A utility for
	creating these files is <em>$SH_UTIL/make_sim4fap.csh</em>.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	<em>-FORCEFFT-</em> indicates that the simulation filters of this station
	are given as FFT filter files (.FLF-files) regardless of what default
	filter type is set.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	<em>-ALERT-</em> marks output traces of this filter entry in red.  This
	could be used to remind the user that this entry is possibly incorrect if
	you are testing filters or if you have incomplete information on your
	recording system.
	</DD>
</DL>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Example entries of a <em>filter_lookup.txt</em> file are given below:
<DL>
	<DD><em>XYZ-BH-Z CMG40T ... 23-Jul-2002</em></DD>
	<DD><em>XYZ-BH-Z STS2 23-Jul-2002 ...</em></DD>
	<DD><em>OLD-SH-Z OLDINSTR ... ... -FORCETAB-ALERT-</em></DD>
