<H2>Menu entry <em>Read Other</em></H2>

<P>Reads data files of foreign formats. A converter program from
the foreign format to GSE1 or GSE2 format must be provided as
an external program. The converter must have the syntax
<em>&lt;converter&gt; &lt;inputfile&gt;
&lt;outputfile&gt;</em> and must be located in the directory
<em>$SH_UTIL</em>. Via
the <A HREF="menu_configure.html">Configure</A> command (parameter
number 72) SHM gets the name of the converter. When the
<em>Read Other</em> entry is
selected, a file selection box pops up. The user specifies the
data file in the foreign format, SHM runs the converter script
on the selected file and creates a temporary GSE file in the
<em>$SH_SCRATCH</em> directory,
which is read in using the standard input command for GSE files.</P>

<P>This flexible interface allows the input of any format where
the user is able to provide a converter program to GSE. However,
since on every input command the conversion to GSE has to be performed,
the interface is not as efficient as a directly implemented reader.</P>
