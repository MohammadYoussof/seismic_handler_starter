<H2>Automatic status check processes at SZGRF</H2>

<p>
The core of the automatic status check is the logmsg database.  It holds
status messages created by various processes which are usually running as
cron jobs.  The messages have different severity which is characterised
as an alert level.  The levels implemented so far are:
<ul>
	<li><i>Alive</i> (numeric value 10): alive messages of cron jobs, created when exiting
	the process in a normal way.  The messages are used to check whether
	all processes are running regularly (done by program <i>ProcessCheck.py</i>). 
	<li><i>Informational</i> (numeric value 20): informational messages
	of cron jobs, e.g. about a newly created data directory (of type C) or
	an ISO file or a DVD has been written.  These messages are for operators
	of the data centre.
	<li><i>Operational</i> (numeric value 25): messages about exceptional
   conditions during data processing in the data centre.  Mainly for
	debugging and code optmisation purposes.
	<li><i>Warning</i> (numeric value 30): messages about conditions which are
	outside the tolerance limits but not severe, e.g. a small time delay in the
	data reception or a moderately low time quality at a station.
	<li><i>Error</i> (numeric value 40): error conditions like a large time lag
	in online data streams or detected timing errors.
</ul>
The messages are collected in a mysql database, named <i>logmsg</i>.  It
contains two tables, <a href="logmsg_table_msgtab.html">msgtab</a> and
<a href="logmsg_table_txttab.html">txttab</a>.  The status of a station
is then determined by the occurrence of a message of a specific alert level
within a given time.  The program <i>MsgDisplay.py</i> evalutes the status
of all stations and displays it visually in window.  As parameter it takes
the (integer) number of hours back in time from now.  Within this time window
it retrieves messages
from the logmsg database.  If warning or error messages are present within this
window it marks the station in yellow or red colour, respectively.
Once a minute it updates the status information.  Possible status changes
are notified by colour changes and optionally by emails sent out to an
address list specified as second parameter.
</p>

<p>
List of modules:
<ul>
	<li> <i>logmsg/CreateMessage.py</i>: utility program to insert a message
        into the message database logmsg (used only in C-shell-scripts and
        interactively for testing).
	<li> <i>logmsg/MsgDisplay.py</i>: main program to display the station
        states and view the corresponding messages.  Is able to send
        emails to specified addresses on status changes.
	<li> <i>logmsg/MsgUtil.py</i>: library of routines necessary for managing
        the logmsg database.
	<li> <i>qualcheck/ProcessCheck.py</i>: program to check alive messages
        of cron jobs.  Is itself used as a cron job and creates messages
        in logmsg when alive messages are missing.
	<li> <i>qualcheck/QualCheck.py</i>: library of quality check procedures
        for waveforms.
	<li> <i>qualcheck/UptimeStatistics.py</i>: executable for creating
        uptime statistics of stations using the sfdb database.
	<li> <i>qualcheck/WaveformQuality.py</i>: program to check the quality
        of the waveforms.  Runs as cron job and creates messages in the
        logmsg database when problems are found.  A more detailed description
        follows.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Program MsgDisplay.py</h3>
Interface program to the <i>logmsg</i> database.  Call is
<i>$DPROG/logmsg/MsgDisplay.py &lt;backhours&gt; [&lt;maillist&gt;]</i>.
&lt;backhours&gt; specifies how far back in time (in hours) the messages
should be read out of the database.  A reasonable value would be 12.
&lt;maillist&gt; is a list of mail addresses, separated by comma, to send
notification mails on status changes.  The display shows a button for each
station and one for the data centre (GRF).  On warning or error conditions
the colour is set to yellow or red, respectively.  Clicking on a station
button will show the messages of the last &lt;backhours&gt; hours for this
station.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Program WaveformQuality.py</h3>
This is the main routine of the quality check procedure for the station data.
Each station is assigned an instance of a parameter class and an array of
quality check procedures.  For both default values are used if no other
specifications are made.  To override the default values for each station
a dictionary of parameter keywords and values can be defined.  This has
to be added to the <i>sparam</i> dictionary.  Legal
parameter names are so far:
<ul>
	<li> <i>chanlist</i>: tuple of channels like <i>('bh',)</i> or
		<i>('bh','hh')</i>.  Channels to checked within the quality procedures.
		Default is <i>('bh',)</i>.
	<li> <i>complist</i>: list of components to be checked.  Default is
		<i>"zne"</i>.
	<li> <i>max_small_online_lag</i>: threshold in time delay (s) for raising
		a warning condition.  Default is <i>1800</i>.
	<li> <i>max_large_online_lag</i>: threshold in time delay (s) for raising
		an error condition.  Default is <i>86400</i>.
	<li> <i>low_timequal</i>: lower threshold in time quality for raising a
		warning condition.  Deafult is <i>65</i>.
	<li> <i>bad_timequal</i>: lower threshold in time quality for raising an
		error condition.  Deafult is <i>50</i>.
	<li> <i>mingapsize</i>: minimum size of a time gap to be detected in s.
		Default is <i>0.001</i>.
	<li> <i>maxgapnum</i>: maximum number of data gaps to be ignored.  Default
		is <i>0</i>.
</ul>
Using the above parameter set a number of quality procedures is executed.  These
procedures are defined in an array.  By default all available procedures are
executed.  To override the default to exclude some or all procedures a
dictionary of station - procedure array has to be defined and inserted
in the <i>sqlist</i> dictionary.
