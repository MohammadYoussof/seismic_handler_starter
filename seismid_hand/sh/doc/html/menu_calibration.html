<H2>Menu entry <em>Calibration</em></H2>

<P>Advanced option. Slowness and back-azimuth values determined
by an array record are usually not perfect, since the waveforms
arriving at the array are distorted by heterogeneities on the
receiver side. This command allows to correct the slowness/azimuth
measurement for such systematic errors. It uses a lookup table
with slowness correction vectors. These correction vectors are
found by investigating representative events in the past, comparing
the bearing of the array with the theoretical slowness and back-azimuth
from the array center to the location given by international data
centers (like ISC or NEIC). These difference vectors are used
to correct the measured slowness/azimuth values. The simple algorithm
implemented here takes the next correction vector and shifts it
to the location of the current measurement in slowness-azimuth
domain. The end of the shifted arrow points to a corrected (calibrated)
result. This method is applicable only if the data set of teleseismic
records is big enough to provide a dense coverage of correction
vectors over the whole range of possible slowness/azimuth pairs.
Also the correction table is usually made with records of the
complete array. If an actual record misses one or even more stations
the correction vectors may not be suitable any more. For the GRF
array such a correction table is provided in the distribution.</P>

<P>There is a calibration lookup file $SH_INPUTS/calib_lookup.txt
which tells SHM which correction table is to be used for which
stations. It contains one line per entry of the format &lt;stationlist&gt;
&lt;calibfile&gt;. Please note that &lt;stationlist&gt; must not
contain blanks. Lines starting with ! are comments and ignored
by the program.  The only entry in this file is the GRF array
pointing to the file of slowness correction vectors $SH_INPUTS/calib_grf.dat.
This file is formatted as follows:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>One line per entry
  <LI>The first 26 characters of each line are comment
  <LI>The following four numers are beam slowness, beam azimuth,
  corrected (theoretical) slowness and corrected azimuth
  <LI>The remaing part of the line is again comment
</UL>

<P>The way to proceed is as follows: after determining the slowness/azimuth
(with <A HREF="menu_plane_wave.html">Plane Wave</A> or
<A HREF="menu_fk.html">FK</A>) select the menu entry <em>Calibration</em>.
A new window pops up showing an area in slowness/azimuth domain
around the measured values. Black arrows indicate available correction
vectors within this area. The red arrow is the suggestion of the
program to correct the beam measurement. The top of the red arrow
may be moved with the left mouse button to adjust the suggested
correction manually. The resulting location and region name is
displayed in the top left corner of the window. The window has
a small drop down menu with the following entries:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><em>Accept</em>: accept
  the current correction values, close window and return to main
  program.
  <LI><em>Quit</em>: do
  not accept corrections, close window and return to main program
  <LI><em>Screendump</em>:
  make hardcopy of the window
  <LI><em>Set Calib Flag</em>:
  mark this event as a candidate for an entry in the calibration
  file
  <LI><em>Clear Calib Flag</em>:
  clear a previously set calibration flag.
</UL>

<P>Leaving the window with <em>Accept</em>
adds the corrected slowness/azimuth values to the analysis parameters
and uses those for following teleseismic locations. Leaving with
<em>Quit</em> does not
change anything in the parameter set.</P>
