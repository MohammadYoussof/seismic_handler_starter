<H2>Menu entry <em>Setup</em></H2>

<P>Temporary setting of some parameters of SHM. Possible values
are listed in an option button menu. The <em>default</em> value
means that the parameter
takes the value out of the <A HREF="menu_configure.html">Configure</A>
setting and has not yet been changed. Changes made her are lost
after restarting SHM.</P>

<P><em>hardcopy</em></P>

<DL>
  <DD>Method of creating hardcopy on printer. Currently there is
  no real choice. <em>fast</em>
  calls the script <em>$SH_UTIL/sd_xwd.csh</em>
  which makes use of the X-Window command
  <em>xwd</em>. This should available on all
  platforms. <em>quality</em>
  calls <em>$SH_UTIL/sd_screendump.csh</em>
  which has been an interface to the <em>screendump</em>
  command of Sun Solaris 1. This is not available any more. If
  somebody knows a method of making good hardcopies, he may implement
  it using this script.
</DL>

<P><em>max. cursor</em></P>

<DL>
  <DD>Selection of last mode of waveform cursors. Clicking the
  middle mouse button changes the cursor until the selected mode
  and then returns to <I>no cursor</I>. See <A HREF="mouse_buttons.html">The
  use of mouse buttons</A> for details.
</DL>

<P><em>normalization</em></P>

<DL>
  <DD>Tells how the traces should be normalised on screen.
  <DD><em>constant</em>:
  amplification of traces with a constant value. All traces on
  display have comparable amplitudes. The displayed amplitude still
  depends on the number of traces on the display. Two different
  plots with the same number of traces on display have comparable
  amplitudes.
  <DD><em>all (tot)</em>:
  all traces on the display have the same amplification, the absolute
  size depends on the largest value read in. I.e. all traces on
  display have the comparable amplitudes, also different time windows
  of the same traces, but different traces read in later have different
  magnification.
  <DD><em>all (wdw)</em>:
  all traces on the display have the same amplification, the absolute
  size depends on the largest value within the visible window.
  I.e. all traces on display have comparable amplitudes, but different
  time windows of the same traces may have different magnification.
  <DD><em>single (tot)</em>:
  the normalization for each trace on display is different, so
  that the maximum value of the whole trace appears with the same
  amplitude on screen.
  <DD><em>single (wdw)</em>:
  the normalization for each trace on display is different, so
  that the maximum value of the visible window appears with the
  same amplitude on screen.
</DL>

<P><em>trace order</em></P>

<DL>
  <DD>Order of traces down-top or top-down.
</DL>

<P><em>filter type</em></P>

<DL>
  <DD>Which filter type should be used for filtering: FFT or recursive.
  See command <A HREF="menu_filter.html">filter</A> for details.
</DL>

<P><em>default filter</em></P>

<DL>
  <DD>Which filter should be applied automatically after read in
  with <em>Read New</em>
  from command <A HREF="menu_read.html">Read</A>. Saves some mouseclicks
  if you usually apply the same filter after reading
  new traces.
</DL>

<P><em>parameter list</em></P>

<DL>
  <DD>Tells whether the verbose form or the brief form of the analysis
  parameters should be displayed on the Show parameters
  and Final parameters commands.
</DL>

<P><em>phase names</em></P>

<DL>
  <DD>Tells whether the full phase name including onset type (e
  or i) and sign (c or d) should appear on the phase marks or only
  the plain phase name.
</DL>

<P>display size rulers</P>

<DL>
  <DD>Changes the size of the main window display. This sizes independently
  from the frame. If the display size is larger than the frame,
  scrollbars are added to the window. This enables the user e.g.
  to work with many traces with a reasonable resolution if he uses
  vertical scroll bars for the display. Be careful: if you make
  the window size larger than possible with the current amount
  of free memory SHM just crashes. This is an internal feature
  of X-Window, I did not yet find a way to prevent this.
