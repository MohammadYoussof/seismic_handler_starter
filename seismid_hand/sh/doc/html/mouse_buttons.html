<H2>Use of the mouse buttons</H2>

<P>Each of the three mouse buttons has functionality in SHM. A
trained user can perform the mouse operations very quickly and
achieve high efficiency in working with the traces. Of course,
the normal mouse functions of the X-Window interface are still
valid in the program. The operations described here refer to activation
of mouse buttons in one of the two display windows of SHM (see
<A HREF="display.html">the display windows</A>). It is strongly
recommended to set the X-Window focus policy to Focus Follows
Mouse (i.e. the window is made active which has the mouse pointer
on it, without clicking onto the window). Otherwise the necessary
clicks on the windows to make it active slow down the operations
and may lead to unexpected results. In particular when working
with shortcuts (almost all menu entries may be activated by hitting
a key on the keyboard, see the characters to the right of the
menu entries) this is important. A shortcut must go into an active
main window.</P>

<H3>Mouse button 1 (left)</H3>

<P>This button is used for creating and deleting phases on the
traces. A single click creates a new phase (with properties taken
from the <A HREF="phasebox.html">phase dialog box</A>), a double
click on an existing phase deletes it. Dragging (= click and move)
an existing phase moves it from one time position to another.
A trace accepts only one phase of the same name, if the phase
already exists the phase marker remains black and unlabeled. Please
check for phases lying out of the visible window. Phase clicks
are allowed in any of the two display windows (main and zoom).</P>

<H3>Mouse button 2 (middle)</H3>

<P>Used for changing the style of the mouse cursor. When starting
up the program the mouse cursor is nothing but the usual arrow.
Clicking the middle mouse button adds a crosshair cursor. This
is useful for comparing times between traces or check amplitude
values (e.g. against the zero line shown at the right border of
the display). Clicking again replaces the crosshair cursor by
a waveform cursor. It takes the waveform from the zoom window
and attaches it to the mouse cursor. With this option you may
compare waveforms between traces or use it for picking of coherent
phases by overlaying a reference trace to the other traces while
picking the onset time. There is a set of waveform cursors following
after this, the complete sequence of cursors is: <em>none</em>
(no cursor), <em>crosshair</em> (crosshair cursor), <em>waveform</em>
(waveform taken from zoom window), <em>negwave</em>
(negative waveform from zoom), <em>hilbert</em>
(hilbert transformation of waveform) and <em>neghilb</em>
(negative hilbert transformation
of waveform). After clicking the second mouse button 6 times you
come back to no cursor. Sometimes it is not desirable to click
so often to come back to the inital state, therefore you can set
the maximum cursor form in the Setup
menu. If you select e.g. <em>crosshair</em>
there, then the middle mouse button toggles between no cursor
and crosshair.</P>

<H3>Mouse button 3 (right)</H3>

<P>Selects time windows on traces (drag box). Clicking and dragging with
this button on a trace in the main window opens and resizes a
drag box. The selected waveform is displayed in enhanced resolution
in the zoom window. If a drag box already exists a click with
the right button lets the box center jump to the mouse position.
Dragging an existing box scrolls a time window of constant
length through the zoom window. If you click on the right border
of an existing drag box, you may resize it. The use of the
3rd mouse button in the zoom window has no effect (up to SHM version 2.4f,
see next paragraph).
To set a time window defined by a drag window for all traces in the main
display window use the command <A HREF="window_op.html#Anker2408454">Set Time
Window</A>. <I>Set Time Window</I> and use the drag windows let you iterate
to an appropriate time resolution.</P>
<P>
Since SHM version 2.4f the drag window may also be moved by the arrow keys.
The up arrow key moves the drag window one trace up, similarly the down arrow
key one trace down.  The left and right arrows move the window by 20% of its
width to the left or right, respectively.  It is not possible to move the
drag window out of display using the arrow keys.  In addition a right mouse
click within the zoom window moves the drag window one trace up (same function
as the up arrow key).  The advantage is that phase picking within the zoom
window can be done much faster on a set of traces, because the mouse doesn't
need to be moved between the zoom window and the main display window.  Before
the cursor keys can be used, the keysym value of the keys must be known to
SHM.  Please use the configuration parameters <I>keysym_arrow_up</I>,
<I>keysym_arrow_down</I>, <I>keysym_arrow_left</I> and
<I>keysym_arrow_right</I>.  To find the
keysym values set the debug level (parameter <I>debug_level</I> in the
<a href="configuration-file.html">configuration
file</a>) to a value of 4 or higher.  All keystrokes then will be protocoled
in the shell window including the keysym value.
