<H2>Menu entry <em>LocSAT</em></H2>

<P>Interface to the location program of Steve Bratt and Walter
Nagy. This program is not part of the distribution of SH/SHM.
It must be copied and installed separately. The code is a mixture
of Fortran and C. For some platforms executable version are available
on <A HREF="ftp://ftp.szgrf.bgr.de/software">our ftp server</A>.
Calling this entry writes all phases which are picked and have
a quality factor (see <A HREF="phasebox.html">phase dialog box</A>)
of at least 2 (!) into a scratch file which is passed to LocSAT
and run. The output of LocSAT is displayed in a text window and
the location results also read into SHM. If the location program
does not work, please check first the quality factor of your phases.</P>

<P>The dialog box of  LocSAT has the following options:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><em>Depth</em>: If
  the value is set to <em>free</em>
  the location algorithm inverts also for depth. This can cause
  instabilities. Fixing it to a value sometimes improves the location,
  if the depth can be guessed. But fixing to a completely wrong
  value also makes the inversion instable (and makes the location
  bad).
  <LI><em>Auto start loc</em>:
  A value of <em>yes</em>
  causes LocSAT to compute a starting location by itself,
  <em>no</em> means LocSAT takes
  the closest station as the starting location.
  <LI><em>Table prefix</em>:
  Prefix of the travel time tables used for the inversion. The
  tables are located in <em>$SH_LOCSAT/tables</em>
  (LocSAT does not use the travel time tables of SH/SHM). The tables
  with the prefix <em>tab</em>
  are created with the IASP91 velocity model. Provide your own
  tables with another prefix, then you may switch between the tables.
  <LI><em>Deg. of freedom</em>:
  Degrees of freedom. I don't really know ...
  <LI><em>Max iterations</em>:
  Maximum number of iterations. After this number of iterations
  the location algorithm is stopped, it does not converge, at least
  not fast enough.
  <LI><em>Brief output</em>:
  Tells whether the output file of LocSAT should be shown as original
  (<em>no</em>, rather lengthy)
  or should be reduced to the most important results (<em>yes</em>).
</UL>

<P>Installation of the LocSAT tar file has to be done in
<em>$SH_UTIL</em>:<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<em>cd $SH_UTIL; tar xvf &lt;locsat-tarfile&gt;<BR
CLEAR="ALL"></em>A man page of LocSAT itself is then found in
<em>$SH_UTIL/locsat/doc/man/man1</em>.
To read it enter in a C-shell:<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<em>setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:$SH_UTIL/locsat/doc/man<BR
CLEAR="ALL">man LocSAT</em></P>

<P>For debugging: what happens is:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>SHM writes three files in <em>$SH_SCRATCH</em>:
  <em>locsat_c.txt</em>
  with control information, <em>locsat_s.txt</em>
  with station information and <em>locsat_d.txt</em>
  with phase readings.
  <LI>It calls the command (in <em>$SH_SCRATCH</em>):<BR
  CLEAR="ALL"><em>$SH_UTIL/LocSAT
  -c locsat_c.txt -s locsat_s.txt -d locsat_d.txt -o locsat_r.txt</em><BR
  CLEAR="ALL">which creates the output file
  <em>locsat_r.txt</em>. All these files remain
  on <em>$SH_SCRATCH</em>
  until they are overwritten by the next call to LocSAT. There
  they may be examined to find any errors in processing.
  <LI>The output file <em>locsat_r.txt</em>
  is reformatted to <em>locsat_edit.txt</em>
  if not switched off in the LocSAT dialog box (option
  <em>brief output</em>).
  <LI><em>locsat_edit.txt</em>
  or (<em>locsat_r.txt</em>)
  is displayed on screen and the location results put to the <A
  HREF="parambox.html">analysis parameter box</A>.
</UL>

<P>Please note a bug in LocSAT: if the path to the travel time
table files (given as <em>$SH_LOCSAT</em>
in <em>$SH_ROOT/setup/shsetup</em>)
is too long (more than 22 characters) the program crashes. If
your path is longer then you have to use a link to your LocSAT
tables directory which is shorter and 22 characters. This link
you have to specify in the definition of <em>$SH_LOCSAT</em> in
<em>$SH_ROOT/setup/shsetup</em>. Do not change
the definition of <em>$SH_LOCSAT_EXEC</em>.</P>
